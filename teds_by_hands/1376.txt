What's up, everyone?

I'm Prince Royce, and it's an honor
to be part of Countdown.

I grew up in the Bronx in New York,

and it was easy to feel
like I had no control

over the issues affecting the world,

being one person in millions
walking down the street.

But that's not true.

Climate change is the defining
issue of our time.

History's defined by moments
when people rise up and laws change.

The decisions we make as individuals
add to this collective forward motion,

and there's so many things we can do,
many ways to take action.

As individuals, as governments
and as businesses,

we can and need to be a part
of this movement for change.

Eat local food, walk or bike more,

talk to your friends and start
a conversation about our environment.

Make wise consumer choices,

understand what you're
spending your money on,

vote for people who share your vision

of a future with net-zero
carbon emissions.

Please check out the Countdown
resources and learn more.

Thank you for caring about each other
and about our planet.

Let's make an impact together;
let's change the world.
