For as long as I can remember,
I've always recognized myself as a girl.

I hung out with all of the other girls,
I talked like the other girls,

and I had eyes only for makeup,
Barbies and girls' toys,

all of which could be found
in the "pink aisle" at Toys 'R' Us.

Before my hair had grown long,

I would wear my favorite
red turtleneck around my head

like Ariel's long flowing hair,

and every Halloween,

I would tell my parents
I wanted to be a girl.

A witch one year,

and a princess the next year,

and another princess the following year,
but you know, Disney.

(Laughter)

The point is, I was clearly a girl,

but the one thing that I couldn't
beg my parents into getting for me

was actual girlhood.

Now if you haven't figured it out
already, I am transgender,

but don't worry, I'm not here
to raid your bathrooms

and take your women.

(Laughter)

I am here to tell you
what it's like to be trans,

what it's like to struggle every day
with acceptance from yourself

and those around you.

And of course, that inevitable question
of "which bathroom do we put this kid in."

I was born in upstate New York

with an identical twin brother
10 minutes behind me,

a mother who always did her best
to make sure I was happy

and a father whose expectations for a son
I did not exactly meet.

He expected that my brother and I --

Jonas, that's his name --

and before you say anything,

yes, I know our names together,
Nicole and Jonas,

do sound like "Nick Jonas" --

he expected that Jonas and I were each
going to get our own baseball gloves,

play catch with him and go hunting.

In fairness, we did do
some of these things.

I turned out to hit
a better home run than my brother,

and I could do it in heels.

(Laughter)

But because of the expectations
that my father had,

it was harder for him to accept
his child as transgender.

He wasn't prepared,

and he didn't have the information
on how to raise a transgender kid.

And of course, there was always
that question for him,

"What do the neighbors think?"

So rather than deal with me,

he buried himself in hobbies

and tried to ignore
the flamboyance of his son.

As you can imagine,

this left my mother
pretty on her own for a while,

when my brother and I were little.

She's an independent woman,

and always tries her best
to see the best in people.

So when it came to her child's gender,

she didn't have a lot of expectations

for what me and Jonas
were supposed to be like.

She didn't care
what the neighbors thought.

She cared whether or not we were safe
around the neighbors.

She knew that the world wasn't always
going to be an accepting place,

so she vowed that at the very least,

I was going to have a safe place
to come back to in her home.

The only problem with that, though,

was that my dad at home didn't get it,

so she started trying to educate him.

She left some literature
lying around for him,

but when he didn't show much interest,

she did what any other
sensible spouse would do.

She left the book in the bathroom.

(Laughter)

And lo and behold,

when he had run out
of other stuff to read in there,

there was the book --

“She’s Not There” by Jennifer Boylan.

This was the beginning of my dad
really trying to come around

to me being transgender,

and everyone in my family helped,

including Jonas, who,
at no more than eight,

walked up to my dad and said,

"Face it.

You have a son,

and a daughter."

With my family on board,

we could start trying to make
my transition public.

We worked with the school up in Orono,

which is where we moved
when Jonas and I were five,

and we all decided
on a gradual transition.

What this meant was,

I wasn't going to burst into school
one day in a full dress, pearls and heels,

and let everyone process that.

What it meant was that we were going
to spread my transition out

over the course of elementary school,

starting with pink,

wearing my hair longer,

using the single-stall girls' bathroom,

followed in fifth grade
by the multistall girls' bathroom,

wearing skirts,

and finally, using my name, Nicole.

What I really liked
about the gradual transition

was that everyone was cooperating,

and it put no strain
on the other students,

because they were all
eased into it with me.

Everything was perfect.

Until in fifth grade ...

A student who had moved there
the year before

and wasn't there
for our gradual transition

told his grandfather about me.

And his grandfather

was part of a special-interest
Christian Right group,

and he didn't think that my using
the girls' bathroom was OK at all.

So logically,

the best course of action
was to send his grandson in after me.

His grandson follows me
into the girls' bathroom one day,

looks me in the face and says,

"My grandpappy says we don't have to have
any faggots in our school."

I didn't know it at the time,

but that was the beginning

of all of my family's hard
work coming apart.

The school stopped cooperating with us.

They pulled me from the girls' bathroom

and made me up to be the one
who'd done something wrong.

After a few months of isolation,

I decided to start
using the girls' bathroom again

of my own accord.

But when the grandson caught on,
he made another stunt,

and again, I found myself
in the principal's office,

with her giving me a look and saying,

"You knew you weren't supposed
to go in there."

So from then on,
through the end of sixth grade,

I was to have a bodyguard,

who was to follow me at all times,

stand 10 feet behind me

and make sure that I use
the isolation chamber of a bathroom,

just because the school was afraid
that the grandfather's group would sue.

I would get up to go
to the bathroom from class,

and the teacher would stop me at the door

and tell me to wait for whoever
was following me that day,

in front of everybody.

The humiliation was unimaginable.

My family eventually
had to leave that school

and leave Orono,

because the school could not
and would not be reasoned with.

For the next two years,
we had to live in hiding.

And live apart, because my father
had to stay behind

to keep his job.

For those next two years in middle school,

my parents had to warn me and Jonas
never to tell anyone who we were

or we would have to move again.

So I shut down for those two years.

I didn't have any sleepovers,

I didn't visit any friends.

I was like a ghost.

I went to school and I came home.

When the time for high school came,

we were approached
by a local private school,

a place called Waynflete.

And ...

From my visits there,
I learned that they were progressive

and forward-thinking.

And my brother and I were both accepted.

And the best part was,

my parents told us
that at this new school,

we wouldn't have to hide anymore.

So at Waynflete,
they start each school year off

by sending the students on a bonding trip.

They do this by dropping the freshmen
in the middle of the woods

and tell us to "get along."

It's charming.

(Laughter)

We stayed in yurts.

(Laughter)

But during this trip,

I noticed something I was struggling with.

I didn't know how to tell
these kids who I was.

In those two years of being so diligent
at keeping my secret,

I had actually forgotten
how to come out to people.

It had been so easy when I was younger --

you know, I would just walk up
to somebody and say,

"My name's Wyatt.

I'm a boy who wants to be a girl.
What's your name?"

(Laughter)

But now it was a mystery to me.

So I spent that entire trip
sitting on my secret,

and I just remember
how uncomfortable I was

when I watched all of my new classmates

get in their swimsuits
and go down to the lake together.

On the bus ride home,
I sat next to a girl named Leah,

who I'd grown particularly close to,

and about halfway through the ride,
she told me that she had a secret.

She told me that she was pansexual.

Imagine my relief.

So ...

You know, this was my chance,

and I latched onto this kid --

like, I'm serious,
I grabbed her and I held her.

And I came out to her on that bus,

for the first time in two years.

And she actually told me ...

that it was cool.

She asked me a couple of questions,

and what she really did was give me
a place to talk about myself

that I hadn't had in years.

And she gave me the confidence
to keep coming out

to other kids at Waynflete
as the weeks went on.

And every response that I got
was very "yes, and?"

The fact that I was transgender
was not big news to these kids,

and they made me feel like it was
the most normal thing in the world.

Because it is.

Another strange thing happened
while I was at Waynflete.

Somewhere during my four years there --

and I don't know when --

I came to be OK with being trans.

I could accept myself and my body.

I came to feel normal,
and I didn’t even realize it.

I was able to reach a point where ...

You know, I wasn't exactly comfortable
with what I had down there,

but it wasn't the biggest
travesty anymore.

And it was people like Leah
who gave me the space to do so.

Acceptance at home
is fundamental, yes, but ...

Frankly, it's just not enough.

Trans youth, like most young people,

spend the majority
of their time in school.

And if you spend Monday
through Friday, from 8 to 3,

being told that you weren't OK,

that you are wrong,

how are you supposed to think otherwise?

Home and community being accepting

together create a space
where kids can accept themselves.

I was able to do it

because the fact that I was trans

wasn't being constantly
shoved down my throat.

And I didn't have to spend
every second of every day

thinking about it, hiding it

and feeling like I was an abnormality.

Trans kids, we deal with this
two-to-three-year-old concept of gender.

Cis kids, your gender
is affirmed immediately.

But trans kids don't get that.

We don't get to focus
on what do we want to be when we grow up.

I don't even remember.

All I remember
is that I needed to be a girl.

And I couldn't move on
until that was affirmed and validated.

I was trapped in gender.

We're reminded of it
on every legal form ever.

Passports, licenses, taxes, applications,

even bathrooms are separated,

male and female.

Now there's a lot of important messages
that I could highlight for you all.

And trust me, I could go on forever

about every little thing
that needs to be done

in the fight for trans equality,

but I'll spare you.

What I want you all
to leave here today knowing

is that you can be Leah.

You have the power to make a difference

in someone's life.

Because you never know

when a transgender person
is going to come into your life,

you need to be prepared
and you need to be ready to help them.

It might just be some kid
at your grandson's school,

or it might be your daughter.

Either way, you have to be prepared.

My father didn't think
it had anything to do with him.

Guess what?

It did.

(Laughter)

If you are on this earth,

you are part of the trans story.

You need to be ready to be Leah.

You have the power to help someone
by imagining more than two boxes,

male or female.

You have the power
to create safe environments

where whichever box they check
isn't the most important part of somebody.

You have the power
to educate others and yourself.

You have the power to bridge those gaps.

You have the power.

Thank you.

(Applause)
