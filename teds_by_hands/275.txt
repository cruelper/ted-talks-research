My father was only 32 years old

when he designed the first
glass office tower in Brazil.

It was 24 stories above
our city of São Paulo,

and it was known as “Pele de Vidro” --

“Skin of Glass.”

It was the golden age of architecture,

a time of great hope and optimism.

Our new capital, Brasília,
was designed by Oscar Niemeyer.

It was the era of bossa nova,

Cinema Novo,

and everything felt possible.

The construction of the “Skin of Glass”
began in the early ’60s.

Tinted glass was imported from Belgium,

marble from Greece,

and it was the first curtain wall
designed in Brazil.

Much like a curtain,

the glass was separated
from the structural frame of the building,

filtering the light and the weather.

People were totally fascinated
by this modern building,

and they would gather outside
to watch automated doors open and close.

My father wasn’t concerned
only with the aesthetics,

but also the comfort of workers,

so he designed this open,
light-filled environment

that was kept cool
by central air-conditioning,

which was a novelty at the time.

I didn’t know any of this until recently.

My father died when I was 14.

We were very close when I was a child,

but as years passed by,

I started forgetting,

and my memories faded.

So I decided,

after 20 years of living in California,

to go back to Brazil
to learn all I could about him.

And I took this journey

by making a film
that I call “Skin of Glass.”

My father designed
over 280 projects in his short life.

The “Pele de Vidro” was his masterpiece
and the work he was most proud of.

And the glass walls
of this building became a mirror,

reflecting the glory and turmoil
of our beloved Brazil.

The building was barely finished
when the military staged a coup in 1964,

and the time of optimism and hope
had a sudden end.

Years later, the government
took over the “Pele de Vidro,”

and it became the headquarters
of the federal police.

So that place of openness and light became
the place of surveillance and censorship.

But it was also the place where
international investigations took place,

including the one of Josef Mengele,

Hitler’s “Angel of Death.”

Mengele had escaped to South America,

and was living in hiding,

and the investigations --

the global investigations
that led to identifying his remains

were led by the federal police
inside the building.

In 2003, the federal police
left the building,

and it was abandoned for many years.

I was amazed to learn that in 2008,

Brazilian and French architects
learned about the building

and hoped to create
a vibrant cultural lab.

They tried to fund the project,

but the markets crashed
and the project died.

So in 2017, I finally saw
the building for the first time,

and I was eager to get inside
my father’s creation

to understand him as an artist.

And I couldn’t have imagined
what had come of this great work.

It’s now occupied by 400 squatters:

homeless families, workers and immigrants.

I wanted to meet them.

I wanted to understand their experience
of living in the building.

I wanted to understand
how they came to live in the building.

I tried to get inside the building,

but the leaders of the people who occupied
the building wouldn’t let me in.

They were afraid of outsiders.

My only window into life in the building

was photographs that were taken
by student photographers years before.

Then my journey to my father
took an unimaginable turn.

Seven people died
and hundreds lost their home.

The city mourned the human tragedy

and the destruction
of its cultural landmark.

For me, there was another layer of grief.

I felt I lost my father again.

The survivors set up an encampment
near the building,

and now they spoke to me
about their lives.

Ironically, only after
the building was gone,

I could understand
the role it played in so many lives.

In my journey to make sense
of this new chapter,

I reconnect with those who had
shared my father’s dream.

I got a call from Pablo Georgieff
and Philippe Rizzotti,

the architects who hoped
to turn the building into a cultural lab.

They had been invited
by the São Paulo Architecture Biennial

to make a tribute to the building
by drawing their cultural lab live.

And at the end of the tribute,

Pablo wrote a letter to my father
to express his gratitude.

And he said,

“Dear Roger Zmekhol,

you gave us a space to amplify our dreams.

This is our turn to give you a gift,

and this drawing is for you.”

The “Pele de Vidro,”

even in its absence --

the idea of it,

the memory of it --

continues to be a reflection of Brazil,

past and present.

Which I love because even though
it’s an empty lot of rubble,

it’s still filled with dreams.

(Portuguese) Muita obrigada.

Thank you very much.

(Applause)
