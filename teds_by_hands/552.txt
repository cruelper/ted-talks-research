Welcome to the TED Interview.

I'm Chris Anderson,

and this is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker,

and we get to dive much
deeper into their ideas

than was possible during their TED Talk.

Today, I couldn't be more excited,

because I'm here with none other
than Sir Ken Robinson.

Sir Ken is the man responsible
for the most-viewed TED Talk of all time.

It's been seen more than
50 million times now,

a talk called
"Do Schools Kill Creativity?"

He recorded it back in 2006.

It was one of the first six
TED Talks that we ever released,

and probably that talk
did as much as any other

to really put TED Talks
as a whole on the map.

(Audio) Sir Ken Robinson: I heard
a great story recently,

of a little girl who was
in a drawing lesson.

She was six, and she was
at the back drawing.

And the teacher said, "This little girl
hardly ever paid attention,

and in this drawing lesson, she did."

And the teacher was fascinated.

She went over to her, and she said,
"What are you drawing?"

And the girl said,
"I'm drawing a picture of God."

And the teacher said,
"But nobody knows what God looks like."

And the girl said,
"They will in a minute."

(Laughter)

CA: The idea he spoke about

seemed to really
strike a nerve with people.

It felt as if millions and millions
of people around the world

had had this experience of being at school

and somehow, their own creativity
not being heard or recognized

or felt or developed properly.

(Audio) KR: I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

we grow out of it;

or rather, we get educated out of it.

CA: Sir Ken has been
a scholar of education

pretty much all his life:
as a professor, a policy advisor

and an author.

And I'm so excited today to have a chance
to ask him more about his ideas.

Sir Ken Robinson, welcome.

KR: It's a real pleasure,
Chris, thank you.

CA: Why don't we start by finding out
a bit about you and your own education.

KR: Well, I'm from Liverpool.

I was born there in 1950.

I'm one of seven children.

We grew up with no money.
We weren't aware of it.

CA: Which one, by the way?
KR: I'm number five.

CA: Number five. So you had to really
carve out some attention in the family.

KR: Well, yes. I mean, my first
three siblings all have middle names,

and my parents kind of ran out of steam

by the time they got
to my end of the list,

and I was just glad
not to be called "Five."

(Laughter)

So I grew up there,

and I had no idea growing up
what I might ever go on to do,

or if I would ever go on
to do anything at all.

So it's always been a big theme in the
work I do that we create our own lives.

It doesn't really matter
where you start from.

CA: As a child, you were hit
by quite a severe illness.

Will you talk about that?

KR: Yeah. Until I was four,

my father was convinced I was
going to be the family soccer player.

I showed an early and precocious
talent for it, evidently.

I was strong and quick.

I had good eye-hand coordination,

and my dad had been a semi-professional
football player himself.

But in the early '50s, there was
an epidemic of poliomyelitis,

which spread right across
Europe and North America,

and I got it, yes.

So at the age of four,

I was in hospital with polio.

I was in for eight months,

and I was paralyzed
overnight, pretty much.

And I was thrown into
the world of special education.

Actually, in the early '50s, people
weren't very good at euphemisms.

We hadn't really got the hang of them.

So I went to the Margaret Bevan School
for the Physically Handicapped,

where I was in the company
of a lot of other people

with calipers and braces and wheelchairs

and various sorts of physical
illnesses or handicaps.

And it threw the whole family
into that world.

CA: But despite that, or because of that,

you did pretty well academically,

and you ended up in a grammar school,

which at the time was the higher
of two tiers of British general education.

KR: Well, yes. It was
interesting how it happened,

because we didn't really pay attention
to people's disabilities.

That wasn't what defined us.

I mean, I didn't think of myself
as having polio,

and I didn't think of the kids
I was talking to as having cerebral palsy.

They were interesting or they weren't.
We were just kids kicking it around.

But what became clear

was that the system itself
didn't have great expectations

for the students,

and I wouldn't be doing what I do now

but for two or three people
who crossed my path.

One of them was a school inspector
called Charles Stratford,

who came into my classroom one day.

I guess I was pushing 10,

and I was sitting back
doing something or other.

I was chatting, I remember,
with one of my good friends at school,

a guy called Robert _____?

who had hydrocephalus, enlarged skull.

And I chatted with this guy for a while,

to this man who I found out later
was Charles Stratford,

and he disappeared.

And a few days later, I was asked
to go and see the head teacher,

and he was sitting there.

It turned out that he was the inspector
for special education,

and whatever had happened
in the conversation,

he spotted something
that he thought was interesting

and had spoken to the class teacher,
then the head teacher,

to ask what was going on with me --
was I being stretched,

and was there something
else I could be doing.

The upshot of that was,
they moved me up a couple of classes,

into the hands of this formidable woman

called Miss York.

And she was a real tartar.

She was a fantastically good teacher
but very demanding,

very compassionate but very demanding,

and she was kind of sewed up
tight like a turkey.

She was trussed in the clothes she wore,
and seemed very buttoned-up.

But at the time in the UK,

we had something that anyone
from the UK will recognize,

called "11 Plus,"

and it was a public exam
that was taken at the age of 11,

on the base of which,
you were allocated --

I, to what was called a grammar school --

and Miss York and the head teacher
and Charles Stratford clearly thought

I was capable of passing the 11 Plus,

and that I would benefit from
some extra tuition to help me do that.

Anyway, the upshot of it was
that I took the 11 Plus,

and I was the first person, I think,
in the history of the schools

to actually do that.

In England at the time,
and certainly in Liverpool,

passing the 11 Plus was like a passport
onto another social plane,

another planet entirely.

Anyway, I passed the 11 Plus
and I was sent to the collegiate,

and it was an absolute turning point.

CA: So any of those individuals

who gave you that sort of
personalized moment in education,

if they could have seen
the story play out,

they would have, I guess,
considered that time well spent,

decisions well made.

You often speak and write
about the importance

of just a personalized approach to kids.

It's not one size fits all at all.

KR: No, I think that's axiomatic.

Education is about people.

It's about human growth and development,

and it's a very personal process.

There's a very important cultural
and social dimension to education,

but we're, each of us, unique individuals,

and we think differently,

we have different capacities,
different talents, different proclivities,

and one of the great criticisms that
I have of mass systems of education

is that they tend to wash out
the differences.

For example, going to the grammar school
suited me down to the ground.

I liked it.

But it wasn't for everybody.

A lot of people went to grammar schools
who didn't like it,

and a lot of people didn't go to them
because they didn't pass the test.

They might have enjoyed it,

but they weren't given
the opportunity I was given.

The interesting thing
about that system is,

it's based on a particular view
of intelligence,

but intelligence is clearly
a much larger idea

than the sort of abilities that tend
to be cultivated in that system.

I'm not critical of
academic education itself;

I rather enjoyed it.

I mean, I was a professor at a university.

I write books. I did a PhD.
It's not as if I'm down on it.

(Laughter)

But it's not the only form of life,

and it's certainly not
the highest form of life.

It's just a form of life.

CA: So any system of education
that just says,

"Let's look for the intelligent kids

and give them special treatment,"
as if that was one spectrum,

one measurement,

that's misguided.

KR: Well, yes, because it's based
on a particular view of intelligence.

For example, the 11 Plus exam.

The point of the 11 Plus exam
was to identify kids

who had the ability and inclination

to benefit from
a grammar school curriculum,

which was an academic curriculum.

And the assumption was that
kids who went through that

would be capable of going on to university

and into some kind of professional role.

The kids who went
to secondary modern schools

were thought to be
less capable of those things

and would probably go on
to some form of manual work.

And the point about it was,
the whole ethos,

was that this was about
equal opportunities

and "parity of esteem,"
as the expression went,

but we all figured out
if you passed the 11 Plus

you went to the grammar school,

and if you failed, you went
to the secondary modern.

So right at the age of 11,
there was a system of sheep and goats.

CA: Almost tied into
the British class system.

This was your ticket to the middle class.

Otherwise, enjoy your life
as working class.

KR: Yes, there's no question of that.

And that wasn't covert,
it wasn't accidental,

it wasn't something that people
were embarrassed to talk about.

If you read the legislation,
the 1944 Education Act,

it was sewn into the fabric
of the legislation.

It was a deliberate piece
of social engineering.

And it had a lot of benefits, by the way.

I benefited enormously from it.

But as many people
who benefited from it did not,

and that's the problem with it.

CA: So where did this interest --

perhaps even obsession with --
creativity in education come from?

And how do you even think
of creativity in education?

KR: Well, creativity is only
a piece of the story, really.

It's what I happened
to talk about on the TED stage,

and I did write a report about it
and I am interested in it,

but it's not the be-all and end-all

of what I think should be
going on in education.

My route into it,

like I think the route most people
take into their lives, their careers,

was circuitous.

When I was at school, I had no idea
what I was going to do, none whatever.

The most practical step I took
to having any kind of career

when I was 16 was to send off
for a set of application forms

to become a manager at Marks and Spencer.

That was it, I thought.
What could possibly go wrong?

CA: Marks and Spencer
is a very sort of staid,

very English clothing store, primarily.

KR: Yes. Most people in Britain
get underwear from Marks and Spencer.

I think it's important
people understand that.

CA: I gave that up a while ago.

KR: Whether that's a good
or a bad thing, we don't know.

But yeah, so I had no idea.

And then when I was in what we call
in the UK the "sixth-form" --

it's the junior and senior
years here in America --

a group of us wanted to put some plays on.

We'd read plays in the English class,
but we wanted to perform them.

It seemed a bit of a heretical idea,
but we thought, why not,

because they seemed very interesting.

And an English teacher
helped us with the plays.

He directed the first couple.

And then we wanted to put another play on

the year or so later.

I thought I was going
to be cast in the play.

I'd been the stage manager
and had a small part in the previous one.

And we cast all the parts,
or he cast all the parts.

He said he couldn't direct it that year,
but he could cast them.

So he came along to the casting session.

All the big parts went,
all the small parts went,

and I was still sitting there,

and I thought, well, that's probably
me doing the stage managing again.

And he said, "I've been giving
some thought to who to direct the play."

He said, "I can't do it this year,
but I have a proposal.

I think Ken should do it."

And I nearly passed out, truthfully.

And I looked around the room
expecting people to crack up and say,

"You must be joking."

And they all said, "No,
that'd be great. Would you do it?"

It had never crossed my mind
to direct a play.

I didn't think I could do it, I didn't
think I had the ability to do it.

I didn't know how to begin doing it.

But eventually, I thought,
well, why not? I should try it.

It's been a bit of a maxim in my life,

truthfully, not to walk away
from things that worry me.

I think it's always better to walk
towards it if you possibly can.

And that just got me involved
in the arts more generally,

and it was through the arts
I got interested, eventually,

in some of the ideas
connected to creativity.

CA: So looking back, is your narrative now

that directing that play
was perhaps as important

as anything else that happened
to you at that school,

in terms of your own development,
confidence, what have you?

KR: No question, yes, yes,
probably the most important thing.

CA: But what would you say
to people who say,

"Look, this is all very nice,

arts are splendid,

very nice that some kids can do that.

But let's get serious.

When it comes to actually
creating a career

that will actually make you real money

and/or contributing to the economy
in a productive way,

what we need is mathematics and science
and technology and engineering,

and we need these STEM subjects.

Really, if your kid could do those,

that, of course, is what
you should emphasize,

and that's what schools should emphasize."

No?

KR: Well, I've got no argument

against the importance
of the sciences and technology.

On the contrary, my way into this
happened to be through theater,

but I'm always very keen
to emphasize this,

it's important.

And I certainly never have wanted
to conflate creativity with the arts.

I mean that in two ways.

The arts aren't important
because they're creative.

Rather, they're not only important
because they're creative.

They're important for all kinds
of other reasons.

They're not the creative bit of education.

The arts can't be reduced to shibboleths
about the importance of creative work,

because through the arts, we express
deep issues of cultural value.

We express the fabric
of our relationships with other people,

our connection with the world around us
as well as the world within us.

They are forms of language
in their own right,

language broadly conceived,

and they are among the most profound ways
that we come to know ourselves

and our relationships to other people

and how cultures become defined.

They are deeply important.

But creativity isn't exclusive
to a particular field.

It's a function of intelligence.

Science, mathematics, technology,
humanities, engineering --

name any form of human
intellectual activity

or any activity that
engages our intelligence,

and it's a scene of potential
creative achievement.

Science is deeply and sensationally
creative at its heart.

It's been transformative
in the lives of humanity,

particularly in the last 300 years.

But just to hook back
to what you were saying:

one of the reasons why
the arts, for example,

tend to be pushed down the hierarchy --

and it's not only the arts, by the way;
physical education is being pushed out,

the humanities are being pushed out --

is because education is dominated
by, on the one hand,

a conception of intelligence

which is rooted in
the university idea of academic work.

And secondly, our education systems
are governed by some idea of utility

about the subjects that will
be most useful for getting a job.

And that's why people say
we need to have STEM disciplines,

because we need more mathematicians,
we need more people doing technology.

Well, it is true that those disciplines
can have a practical application.

It's also true that the arts,
broadly conceived, the creative industries

make a major contribution
to the vitality of our economies,

to the life and soul of our communities.

If you look at great companies
like Apple, like Amazon, like Google,

that are at the leading edge
of technological change,

their work and their success
has been driven by design,

by artists, by writers, by musicians.

It's not only scientists.

So there is a need to take a balanced view

of what sort of skills are needed
to nurture the development

of our current economic systems
and how they may themselves be changed.

But also, our lives are not linear.

We don't know how
people's lives will play out.

I often ask people
at conferences these days

how many of them are doing now
what they thought they'd be doing

when they were 15,
and very few of them have.

I mean, the best evidence
of human creativity

is our trajectory through life.

We create our own lives.

And these powers of creativity,

manifested in all the ways
in which human beings operate,

are, I think, at the very heart
of what it is to be a human being.

And we overlook them, really,
at our peril in our school system.

CA: So this is a huge issue, though,

because if it was hard when we were 15
to predict what it is we might be doing,

it feels like it's massively harder now
for someone who is 15

to have a sense of what
they might be doing,

because we almost know

that a large number of the jobs,
the career paths,

that people have gone through for years
are about to be taken away

by some form of automation.

So how on earth do we
get kids ready for life?

Should we be shifting to trying to create

this sort of ideal set of skills,

of modes of thinking,

of character traits,

that are best equipped to give someone
a chance at surviving the brave new world

that we may or may not be entering?

How ... how would you ... ?

You know, if you were in a kitchen
making this recipe

for what you want to put into a kid
facing the future now,

what would be the elements
that would go in,

that education should be thinking about?

KR: Well, let me just preface that,
because I want to answer that.

But to preface it:

it's important, I think,

to try and get some handle on
what's unique about the times we live in

and what's the same old same old.

People have been talking about
catastrophic effects of new technologies

pretty much since human beings
started to make tools at all.

I mean, technologies do two things,
whether it's a plow or a laptop.

Firstly, they can extend
our physical reach.

We can do things physically that we
would not be able to do without the tool.

The plow made it possible
to cultivate great tracks of land

much more quickly than we could
have done by hand or with a small shovel.

But a transformative tool
does more than extend our physical reach.

It extends our mind.

It makes it possible to think about things

that we literally couldn't conceive of

before the tool made it
possible to think that way.

Like the internet; it makes
it possible to do things,

the iPhone makes it possible to do things,

that we couldn't before.

But long before these things,

the motorcar, the printing press
did the same thing.

It overturned established
ways of thinking,

established ways
in which cultures operated,

and threw countless people out of work;

created new jobs,
destroyed old traditions,

destroyed old ways of life,

while new ones came out
of the compost of the old.

And that's always happened.

CA: But it feels to me like
there's a profound difference now,

just based on timescale.

I mean, say it was your grandfather
who invented the plow,

and you were asked,

"What's the biggest thing
that's happened in society recently?"

"Well, it's the plow! It's amazing.

Now we can grow crops
much more efficiently.

It's astonishing, it's giving me
a whole new thought about agriculture

and the potential for human civilization."

That person's grandkids,
asked the same question,

would basically say: "Yeah, yeah, yeah,

my great-great-great-grandfather
invented the plow."

Nothing had happened since then.
For generations, things stayed the same.

And what feels different now
is that we have barely had a chance

to get familiar with the world
of the internet, let's say,

or the shocking changes that's brought on
that we didn't predict,

like social media, cyberbullying,
whatever, you name it,

all these things that no one
really saw coming.

And before we've even had a chance
to get used to that,

much more dramatic changes
could be a mere decade or so away,

and here we are still using
what you and others have called

this sort of industrial-age education.

Education hasn't adjusted to the internet,
let alone the world of AI.

So how panicky should we feel
about where we are right now?

KR: Well, I don't think
we should be panicking,

but we should certainly
be taking this seriously

and treating it as urgent.

I mean, the point I was making
is that human life has never been immune

to catastrophic and cataclysmic change,

and technology has always
been at the forefront of that.

But what is different about now
is, well, two things, really.

One is the speed at which these
technologies are building on each other

and proliferating

and moving us in directions
we couldn't possibly have anticipated.

So there's a massive technological
agenda here, and it's accelerating,

and that's the nature
of technological change:

it becomes exponential.

And the other thing is the extraordinary
rate of population growth

that we've experienced since the dawn
of the Industrial Revolution.

I mean, when I was born in 1950,

there were fewer than
three billion people on the planet.

By the turn of the millennium,
there were six billion,

so the population doubled.

And we're now at, what,
about seven and a half billion.

Estimates vary, but we're heading
to probably nine, 10 billion

by the end of this century.

Well, we have no idea if the planet
can tolerate us in this way.

There was a wonderful documentary
on the BBC a few years ago,

presented by David Attenborough.

It was about how many people
can live on earth.

It was called, "How Many People
Can Live on Earth?"

I mean, the BBC has a gift
for titles, as you know.

And the question they asked is:

Given that every human being needs food,
fuel, water and clean air to breathe,

how many of us can the earth sustain

on the current levels
of production and consumption?

And at the end of it, it was concluded

that if everybody on the earth
consumed all these things --

food, fuel, water and energy --

at the same rate as
the average person in India,

the earth could sustain a maximum
population of 15 billion people.

So we're halfway there.

Now, the trouble is, we don't
all consume as they do in India.

They said if everybody on the earth
consumed at the same rate

as the average person in North America,

the earth could sustain a maximum
population of 1.5 billion.

So we're five times past that already.

Now, the evidence is, of course,

everybody does want to live
pretty much as we've been living

here in the so-called
developed economies, and --

CA: Maybe with a few edits.

KR: With a few edits.

But if you look at the rate
of our consumption,

we're not putting the planet at risk.

I always find it wry when people say
we have to save the planet.

The planet's been around
for four and a half billion years.

The planet's going to be fine;
we may not make it.

What we're imperiling
are the conditions of our own survival

as a species on the planet.

I mean, the earth will shake us off
like a rash if we don't get this right.

CA: And many other species.

KR: And many other species whose existence
we're already threatening

and have destroyed many of them already.

So what we have is a rapidly
growing population of human beings,

accelerated by a growing appetite for
what the earth can make available to us

and powered by proliferating technologies.

So when I say we need to look
at what's new and what's the same

as in the past,

technological change
and cultural restlessness is the same,

but the rate at which
all this is happening is brand new,

and it's why I would say,
and many people would agree,

and it's what's in your question,

is that we are facing challenges
on the planet as a species

that are unprecedented.

We've never faced these before,
and we're trying to grapple with them

through an education system
that was designed in the 19th century

to do something else, to face
the first wave of industrialization.

There was a wonderful quote from HG Wells
in the early 20th century,

and I believe it to be true.

He said, "Civilization is a race
between education and catastrophe."

I think it's exactly right.

Our only hope here is how well
and how thoroughly and in what way

we educate our own children
and future generations

and the skills and competencies
that we cultivate within them.

And the current system is inadequately
designed to cope with any of that.

That's why it has to be revolutionized.

CA: So that is an incredible quote.

And there's a puzzle here, to me.

You spoke about the incredible impact
that industrialization had upon the world.

But what was interesting
is that the world responded

by building a new education system

that used many of the principles
of manufacturing at scale

to pump minds through this process
where they would emerge

with a standardized set of skills,

able to continue "manufacturing
empire God-knows-what."

Why hasn't the same thing happened?

The world's supposed to be
more advanced now.

We're past the industrial age.

We're in the knowledge age,
the internet age, call it what you want.

It's definitely an age where completely
different principles already apply

throughout culture, throughout politics,
throughout the economy.

We're still in this industrial-age
model of education.

Why has it got so locked in,
so intransigent?

KR: When we talk about
the industrial model of education,

there are people who say
this is an exaggeration,

that it's not an industrial system,
it's not at all like a factory.

Well, the fact is, the mass systems
really were developed in the 19th century,

as you say, to meet
the needs of industrialism.

And that workforce,
the economic workforce,

the Industrial Revolution,

was roughly 20 percent
professional people,

professional and administrative people,

people who worked in suits
indoors in offices,

and about 80 percent manual.

And the system was designed that way.

For example, the 11 Plus
and the grammar school systems in the UK

were created to mirror
that workforce requirement.

It wasn't that only 20 percent of people
could go to grammar school.

It was that only 20 percent of people
were needed to go to grammar schools.

It was a professional net.

So it was a species of linear planning
from that point of view.

The other way in which
it modeled industrialism

was in the organizational structures.

We educate kids by age group. Why?

It has no relevance to how kids learn.
It's an efficiency model.

CA: It's very convenient.

KR: It is. It's an efficiency model,
an organizational model,

not an educational principle.

We divide the day up into 40-minute bits.

We ring bells and we divide it up
into different subjects.

The world isn't divided
into separate subjects.

Subjects are an invention of schooling

so we can find a way of organizing the day
and have a timetable

and teach people according to
the specialisms of the people

who graduate in these
things from universities.

So it's the character of education
which has to be revolutionized.

But there's another story here,

which is that the system is actually
changing very rapidly and radically

at the grassroots level.

I wrote a book a couple of years ago
called "Creative Schools,"

trying to document some of these changes.

CA: So tell us some of those stories,

because I think people really,
really want to see that happen.

KR: Let me just give you
one quick example.

There's a school in the UK
up in the north of England

that I was reading about recently.

It's called Feversham.

It has a very high population of kids
from different cultural backgrounds,

a lot of them non-English speakers.

And for a long time, it was
a school not doing well.

There's a pretty draconian system
in the UK, as there is here in America,

of testing and testing and testing,

of big pressure on the STEM disciplines.

And this school was not doing well.

They have a head teacher there now

who decided to tackle this
from a different perspective.

He introduced into the school
a very broad program

of music and drama courses.

It's an elementary school.

And they're doing about five hours a week
of these different disciplines,

and in a very short amount of time,

the result has been that
attendance at school has rocketed,

parental satisfaction
has increased enormously,

kids are doing well not just in
those disciplines, but across the board.

There was a school called
Orchard Gardens in Massachusetts

which had the same effect.

I was looking at this school a while back.

It went through, I think,
five principals in six years.

It was a school nobody wanted
to send their kid to.

And the school was spending
about 250,000 dollars a year on security.

This is an elementary school. Security.

They had a new head teacher come in,

and he decided that the way forward
was to get rid of all that.

He dismissed all the security staff

and invested all the money
into cultural programs at the school.

He sacked and brought in some new staff.

They came up with an entirely new ethos.

The school is flourishing.

Now, they're art examples,

but if you look at well-known
example in California,

there's a group of schools
called High Tech High.

These are schools which are
secondary schools, high schools.

All their work there is project-based.

They don't have formal bells ringing.

They don't have formal
timetables in the school,

where kids have to move every 40 minutes.

A lot of it is teamwork,
collaborative work.

They do high-level science and technology,

and they also, by the way,
have good arts programs in the schools,

just as these other schools I mentioned

also have good mathematics
and science programs.

What's common to them is they have
a very flexible approach to the timetable,

they recognize that the key to all of this
is not just the curriculum

but it's pedagogy, and that they --

CA: Explain what you mean by that.

KR: I mean that there are --

if you think of it, there are sort of
four major elements to education,

particularly, to a school-based education.

There's the curriculum, which is
what we want people to learn.

There's pedagogy, which is
how we help people do it.

There's assessment, which is
the process of making judgments

about how well kids are getting on.

And then there's
the environment of the school

in which all this takes place,

the physical and the social
environment in which it happens.

Now, most countries in the world
over the past 20 years

have been trying to raise
standards in education.

In America, since the legislation
"No Child Left Behind,"

states and the federal government
collectively spent billions of dollars

on standardized testing,

particularly to try and raise standards
in mathematics and languages and science,

and it's been a total waste
of money, time and effort.

CA: You'd have said at the time
that going that route isn't the way,

kids aren't machines,

you can't just dial up the gauge
and demand a higher level of results

and expect to see it happen that way,

that the key is -- is what?

It's taking a more personalized approach,

of understanding every kid is different
and trying to build that into the system.

KR: Well, the focus
of these reform movements

has been on curriculum and assessment.

And the effect has been
to narrow the curriculum

onto a group of disciplines

that politicians have thought
to be more useful,

particularly for economic growth
and development,

and on assessment,

which they have taken to be
the way of guaranteeing

that the standards are being delivered.

And the form of assessment
that's been followed,

it's been a very narrow, normative,

competitive form of assessment,

and none of it's worked.

The reason is that the curriculum
has become too narrow,

it's the wrong form of assessment.

But also, what really makes
a difference in student achievement,

what really makes the difference,

is pedagogy.

It's the quality of teaching and learning.

If you think back
to your own time at school,

certain teachers jump out
at you in your memory,

the ones who turned you on,
the ones who turned you off.

Teaching is an art form,
and what it's been reduced to

is a sort of delivery system,

a kind of service agent
for the testing companies.

And that's not true
of the schools I'm talking about.

The ones that have been turned
around have recognized

that at the heart of a school
is this idea of a learning community,

and a learning community works best

when students and teachers
are working together collaboratively.

People learn best when they learn
with and from each other,

so getting those conditions right.

And the impact of an hour of curriculum

and of this harsh culture
of standardized tests

is to kill off those conditions.

It's why it doesn't work.

CA: Help me understand this,

because I'm outside of education,
but I'm interested in technology.

Obviously, in the last 20 years,
there's been this spectacular revolution,

this thing called the internet.

Suddenly, everyone in
the developed world pretty much

and an increasing number of people
elsewhere in the world

have access to a little device

where they can ask a question
and basically get an answer to it.

Knowledge as it used to be thought of

is ubiquitous, free,

available on demand.

But it doesn't feel to me
like education systems,

the way in which we set curriculums,

have remotely adjusted
to how dramatic a shift that is,

that knowledge defined as anything
that you could Google (Laughs)

is there in abundance.

Am I right in thinking that, basically,
it's foolish for us to be teaching stuff

that could be Googled?

We should be teaching other stuff.

What is that other stuff?

How do we prepare people for a world
where there's so much knowledge out there?

What are the key skills?

Because just knowing the date
that a certain battle was fought

in the 17th century

clearly isn't one of the things
we really need to be teaching now.

I don't think -- unless
I'm missing something.

KR: Well, I don't know.

I've just been interviewed
for American citizenship,

and I was pleased I was able
to give the correct date

for the Constitutional Convention.

No, there's a difference, isn't there,

between information and knowledge
more generally conceived,

and Google and the other resource
of the internet, Wikipedia,

are fantastic repositories and resources

for a certain type of knowledge
and understanding,

knowledge that something is the case.

But there's a related form of knowledge,

which is the nature of what it is
to have an experience of something,

the nature of human experience,
the qualities of being alive,

CA: The inner life.
KR: Our being in the world, yes.

So, for me, a big
starting point for all of this

is that human beings live
not just in the one world but two,

and education has to address them equally.

There's the world around us, the world
that was here before we got here,

the world that will be there
when we've gone.

And we need to help kids
understand that world --

its culture, circumstances,
how it evolved, how it works,

and how they can connect to it.

But there's this other world
that exists only because we exist,

the world that came into being
when we did, the world of your inner life,

through which you experience
the world around you,

that only exists because you do
and will not be there when you've gone.

We only know the world around us
through this inner world,

and our schools are very poor on the whole

at helping kids connect
with this world within.

And it's only through that world
that they really make sense

of the world around them.

And it's why we need balance.

So at least on that basis,

you'd think that education
would have at least four big purposes:

they're economic, they're cultural,
social and personal.

And for those reasons,
you need a broad curriculum,

and yes, all these aids out there
are tremendous resources.

I mean, when I was doing
my graduate studies in the '70s and '80s,

we did have a similar resource.

It was called the library.

We used to go to that and read the books.

This is a much more convenient
way of getting to it.

I mean, Wikipedia is
an astounding achievement, I think,

in terms of the collaborative archiving
of human knowledge and understanding.

But it isn't enough just
to know this stuff in theory

or to read it online.

There's much more to education than that.

You have to live these things
and experience them.

CA: So Ken, you speak eloquently
about the power of teaching

and how much difference
a great teacher can make,

has made in your life and can make.

But I wonder whether we've
all taken enough note

of how technology could potentially

empower teachers
to redefine aspects of teaching.

I mean, right now we expect
a teacher who is teaching,

say, nine-year-olds,

is supposed to both
teach them instructionally

but also be a mentor,
a coach, a disciplinarian,

a kind of early career
counselor, whatever.

There are so many roles in there.

And yet, couldn't there be
more specialized roles here?

Like, one thing that we've seen online now

is that a great teacher,
in the instructional aspect of teaching,

in that aspect,

a great teacher can instruct and inspire
potentially millions of kids

with a single lesson.

Shouldn't we be thinking
more about saying,

"You know what -- for the
instructional part of teaching,

it's kind of mad that we expect
to duplicate that

thousands and thousands
and thousands of times

with a wide set of individuals,

many of whom just may not have
the language or the deeper insights

that really allow you to make
that subject come alive."

You know, I hated history at school.
I hated it. I was so bored by it.

Since then, I've met historians
who absolutely enthrall me.

If I could have been taught
by those historians,

that could have changed who I am,

and now today, those historians
could teach literally millions of kids.

So in such a world, then, wouldn't that
make it more possible for other teachers

to build relationships with kids
and deepen this sort of personalization

that seems to be so key to really
getting the best out of kids?

So at the very least,

relationship-based teachers
versus instructional-based teachers --

is there potential for education
to really build more of that distinction,

and couldn't that enrich
the education experience for kids?

KR: Well, as you say, teaching
involves all kinds of roles,

and great teachers have all kinds
of techniques at their disposal.

The new technologies
have a transformative potential

for how we think of how schools work.

One of the ways that technology
is helping to revolutionize education

is it opens up, as you say,

the resource of the world's
greatest teachers to everybody.

And there's no reason
why a classroom teacher

shouldn't make available
these resources to kids,

because they're bountiful,
and they're becoming more so,

and there are, by the way,

websites that are sharing this expertise,

and good schools are using them
and use them very productively.

I mean, it's one of the ways that TED
has become so influential, isn't it,

in education.

People are using the resource
that TED makes available

in all kinds of ways in schools
to stimulate lesson programs

and help courses of work.

The thing I just want
to say about it, though,

is that technology is one of the reasons
we have to transform education,

and it's also one of the ways
we can transform education.

I think that's important to recognize.

But it's not the whole answer.

I've seen schools where kids
are spending seven hours a day

at computer terminals,

and it's a tragic thing
to be doing to young people,

because we grow holistically.

And what that means is it's also important

that children don't just spend time
with technological devices,

they spend time looking
into each other's eyes.

They spend time working
together as groups.

They get outdoors.

One of the prices we've paid with this
obsession with academic work and testing

is that we have absolutely shriveled
the importance and the place of play

in children's lives.

It's a deeply and profoundly important
part of how children grow up.

They should be outdoors,
running around, playing together.

They should be in the countryside
as much as they possibly can.

But if not, if they're
in big urban settings,

at least as close to nature
as they can get.

So the technology is important,
but it's not the only part.

But it can free up an awful lot
of other time for other sorts

of ways of connecting and learning.

CA: Yeah, I think I could never
have become an entrepreneur

if I hadn't spent half my youth
playing Monopoly.

(Laughter)

KR: Is that right? CA: That's one theory.

There's no business in our family,
but yeah, play in general.

KR: And did you find you had
a gift for Monopoly?

CA: I found that I got really,
really angry when my sister won,

and it was very motivating.

(Laughter)

No, it definitely makes you think.

It makes you think about
negotiation and so forth,

and you build -- I mean,
every type of play builds life skills.

So let's try and build a school, Ken.

So I've got a building for you,
if a building is necessary.

There's several million dollars.
You can invest how you want.

And we're going to welcome a class
of a hundred kids of different ages

in three months' time.

How do we get ready for them?

What would be some things
that you would love to see happen,

let's say, on that first day at school?

What do we say to these kids?

KR: Are we taking over
an existing building, or -- ?

CA: Yeah, you can fit out the building
however you want to.

Right now, it's just this huge, empty box.

You can put in rooms, leave it open.
You can do whatever you want.

And there's lovely outdoor space as well.

KR: There's a very interesting book
called "The Third Teacher,"

which is about the impact
of the physical environment on kids

and how they learn.

So the first thing is,

I'd want the design of the school
to have flexible spaces.

I don't mean, though,
for it all to be open plan,

but kids need time to be on their own
as well as to be together.

So we'd be looking for flexibility.

There would be a large assembly place,

because the best schools, in my view,
are built on democratic principles.

There is, by the way, a big movement
for democratic schools.

A democratic school
is one in which the students have

a substantial and serious role

in the decisions the school
makes about curriculum,

about teaching, about the timetable,

about everything
that goes on in the school.

In terms of the curriculum,

the curriculum, I believe,
has to be balanced

between the arts, broadly conceived,

sciences, technology, mathematics,
physical education, the humanities,

and they would be equally important,
there'd be no hierarchy.

CA: You'd mix up ages
with these different classes?

KR: Absolutely.

When kids leave school
at three or four o'clock in the afternoon,

they don't go to separate compounds
for four-year-olds or eight-year-olds.

Families work that way.
Communities work that way.

We learn with and from each other.

And all the evidence
has been for a long time

that young and old kids learn
wonderfully well from each other,

sharing expertise.

Also, it's a good example
of where the system creates the problem.

Some kids are way ahead of other kids
at the same age in different disciplines.

Some are behind relatively,
but maybe ahead in some other field.

If you keep putting barriers up
by age group to hold people back

or push them forward,

it can create all kinds
of problems in itself.

So yes, I would have no age distinctions.

There would be a lot of other people
invited to work in the school

apart from the teachers.

CA: Like who?

KR: Adults other than teachers,
obviously subject to the ordinary screens.

You'd want to be make sure
they'd be safe and so on,

but schools, properly conceived,
are the hub of communities.

A great school can enliven
and energize an entire neighborhood.

I've seen that happen.

And schools which are not full
of energy and vitality

can bring a neighborhood to its knees.

So there is a big role
for parents, for example,

in the education of their own children.

There's a big role for people
who specialize in different fields

and disciplines.

People have all kinds of expertise
in business, the crafts,

and community and cultural organizations,

that can flow through and irrigate
the whole culture of a school.

So the curriculum would need
to be broadly based,

and there would be
choice in the curriculum.

I do think there's a case for making sure
that kids are exposed equally

to what the different
disciplines have to offer.

I mean, they're are all kinds
of things I learned at school

that I wouldn't have been inclined
to learn if I hadn't been obliged to.

CA: Well, you wonder whether there's
some system that is somewhere between

giving kids just free choice
right from the start

to torturing them with four years
of something they didn't want to do.

You could set up ... well,
they are going to have to go through

two or three weeks
of a full array of subjects,

and both teacher and kids get a sense
of whether there's some kind of fit here.

KR: Well, that's right.

and in a democratic school system,
that is typically the case,

that you're able to experiment,
try, explore different disciplines.

And, of course, the teachers
are then on their mettle

to make it engaging and interesting,

if you know that the customer
may walk out the door.

Again, it's a very fine line
in all of this,

because learning
is a personal responsibility.

It's like getting physically fit.

If you go to the gymnasium and just stand
leaning on the equipment all afternoon,

you're not going to benefit
from being there.

And if people are in a school
properly conceived,

they have to show their own agency.

They have to become engaged
and practically active

in their own learning.

Nobody can learn anything for them.

All teachers can do
is create the conditions

where it's more likely to happen.

But yes, I'd want to see a lot of choice.

You'd want to see a lot of flexibility

in the time available
for different activities.

You know, at the moment,
we tend to have days,

particularly in secondary schools,

that are cut up into regular time slots,

and it's an efficiency model.

But with an individualized curriculum,

it's possible to spend
as much time as you need

to focus on the thing in hand,
which is what we do typically

when we get out of school.

And by the way, there are schools that
are doing all the things I'm talking about

and have been for a long time.

But the trouble for them, often,

is they're doing it in spite of
the dominant political culture,

not because of it.

They're having to push back against
this dreary culture of testing.

But there are three ways
to think about it.

One of them is that you can make changes
within the system as it is.

One of the things I always
say to teachers is:

the education system isn't only
capable of changing,

it is changing.

But I also want to say to them:

if you're a teacher or a head teacher,
you are the system.

You're not the only part of the system,
but you're a big part of it,

and when the door closes
on your classroom, if there is a door,

and you face those kids today,

you are the education system for them,
and what you do next is the system,

and there's a lot more room
for innovation in schools

than people often believe.

A lot of what goes on in schools
is influenced by legislation,

but it's not required in legislation,

for example, all the things we're talking
about, about educating kids by age group,

by having set periods of time,
having bells go off or whistles go off,

having a hierarchy of subjects.

Those things aren't required in law.

They're institutional habits,
and they can be broken,

and a lot of the schools
that I visit and recommend,

some of the ones I mentioned earlier,

are making these innovations
within the system as it is.

There's nothing, actually,
to stop you doing it.

It takes an effort of will and vision
and great leadership

on the part of the school,

but these innovations
are actually happening.

But also, you can make
changes to the system.

If parents and teachers
are keen to make the changes,

there are movements
that are favorable to them

that they can join and become part of.

They can get more involved
in the legislative process.

And the third option is,
you can get out of it.

If you really feel that there's
no future for you in the system,

there are alternatives --
homeschooling, un-schooling --

and all of these are being
deeply facilitated

by the opportunities
that are available online.

CA: System change is hard,

but what I hear you saying is:

hang in there, change could happen
faster than any of us know.

And frankly, I think your talk
has played a role in all of this.

I mean, you spoke in 2006, 12 years ago.

(Audio) KR: So I want
to talk about education,

and I want to talk about creativity.

My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

and we should treat it
with the same status.

(Applause)

Thank you.

(Applause)

That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much.

(Laughter)

So, 15 minutes left.

(Laughter)

CA: TED Talks weren't
on the internet then.

You just showed up,

and you stood up in the room there

and captivated everyone,
yes, in the moment.

We were all roaring with laughter.
We were all inspired.

And then this thing online
just somehow took on a life of its own,

and it's now been seen
by 51 million people.

How did this happen?

I mean, first of all,
you as a public speaker --

how did you become such
an extraordinary public speaker,

able to just hold an audience
in the palm of your hand?

KR: That's drugs, really.

Drugs and hormone tablets.

(Laughter)

It's hard to say about that, really.

It's never something that I thought about
or pursued or had an ambition to do.

But I find that when I get up
in front of a roomful of people,

I want to have a connection,
a relationship with them,

which is what it's about.

(Audio) KR: When my son
was four in England --

actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

(Laughter)

KR: And, I mean, I get nervous doing
like everybody does, or should.

(Audio) KR: He was in the nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

(Laughter)

No, it's a big. It's a big story.

KR: And the first little while
for me giving a talk

is about getting that relationship,
getting us all settled down.

I mean, I don't like listening
to people give talks, either.

So it's important to have
a rapport with the room.

(Audio) KR: Kids will take a chance.
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

KR: It's like jazz, I think,

or improv.

(Audio) KR: Now, I don't mean to say
that being wrong is the same thing

as being creative.

What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

you will never come up
with anything original,

if you're not prepared to be wrong.

And by the time they get to be
adults, most kids ...

KR: I mean, when I came to TED,
I hadn't written the speech out,

I hadn't rehearsed it,
I hadn't practiced it,

I certainly hadn't memorized it.

But what I have is an arc
of the talk I want to give.

I always think of it
in five pieces, truthfully.

Over time, I've come
to think of it that way.

There's an introduction,

and then there's a set of premises
I want to deal with,

I kind of develop them,
and then I wrap it up.

It's bookended by an intro
and a conclusion,

and there's a kind of
three-part section in the middle.

It doesn't always go that way.

It's just the way I think of it
when I'm planning it.

Now, I have some notes in my pocket
with just some bullet points,

and it's like a set list
is how I think of it,

because every audience is different
and every occasion is different.

I always find when I'm giving a talk,

I take it for a walk and I take
the audience for a walk with me.

The whole trick is to make sure
you land it at the end.

There are like three
or four things in the air

by the time you get to the end of it.

(Audio) KR: There was a wonderful
quote by Jonas Salk, who said,

"If all the insects were
to disappear from the earth,

within 50 years, all life
on earth would end.

If all human beings
disappeared from the earth,

within 50 years, all forms
of life would flourish."

And he's right.

What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

We have to be careful now

that we used this gift wisely

and that we avert some
of the scenarios that we've talked about.

And the only way we'll do it
is by seeing our creative capacities

for the richness they are

and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

And our task is to educate
their whole being

so they can face this future.

By the way -- we may not see this future.

But they will.

And our job is to help them
make something of it.

(Applause)

CA: It feels like you spoke
to this large group of people

who almost felt failed by education,

or they felt they had failed in education,

and I think that they heard your talk
and almost felt seen for the first time,

of, "Oh, maybe that wasn't my failure.
Maybe that was the school's failure"

And that sort of validation,
I think, was deeply powerful.

Here's hoping, Ken,

that the millions of kids
in school right now

facing this impossibly uncertain future,

that they will find someone
who will see them in that same way.

KR: We're born with these massive
capabilities and capacities.

Whether we realize them is a question
of how well we cultivate them

and whether we recognize
them in the first place.

A lot of our talents are like
the world's natural resources.

They're often buried beneath the surface.

You have to find them.

When we find them, we have to refine them,

and then we have to have
the confidence to use them.

And, properly conceived,
education should help us all do that.

but for all kinds of reasons
we've talked about, it doesn't always.

I don't blame individual
teachers or schools for it.

It's in the system,

and it's a system that needs to shift,
and it's important that we do.

But I also want to say to kids

that you can't anticipate
the whole course of your life in advance.

You don't get your CV
with your birth certificate.

Your life is your own creation.

And it's not irrelevant
where you start from,

but the history of human achievement
is that people have done remarkable things

from very improbable beginnings.

I remember a while ago,
I did a session with the Dalai Lama

in Vancouver,

and one of the things he said there
was that to be born at all is a miracle,

so what are you going
to do with your life?

Every human life is different, unique,
and unrepeatable and unprecedented,

and the one thing we create
is our own unique biography.

The best evidence
of human creativity is that,

that we each have our own
unique experience,

and nobody else has your life.

And we often submit to the idea
that it's all a linear program,

because we have to write
our CVs from time to time

and fool people into
thinking it was a plan.

But it's really a constant
process of improvisation.

Really, I'm just arguing
for forms of education

that give people the skills
and the competencies

and the hope and the confidence

to have the life they deserve

in a community that they feel proud of.

CA: Sir Ken Robinson, thank you so much,

both for your TED Talks
and this conversation

and for all you do.

Thank you.

KR: My pleasure. Thank you, Chris.

(Music)

CA: So that's about it for Season 1
of the TED Interview.

But I have some news for you.

We're planning a second season.

You know, TED's a nonprofit
devoted to spreading ideas,

and what we've heard from you is that
you like this version of sharing ideas,

of going deeper than
is possible in a TED Talk.

So we'll be back soon
with another set of conversations.

In the meantime, look out
for a bonus episode coming soon,

and if you get a chance,

do share this podcast with friends
and rate and review it on Apple Podcasts

or wherever you listen.

I read every review,

and it will help us as we record Season 2.

This week's show, per usual,
was produced by Sharon Mashihi.

Our associate producer
is Kim Nederveen Pieterse.

Our show is mixed by David Herman.

Our theme music
is by Allison Leyton-Brown.

And since this is the end of the season,
some special thanks are in order

to Helen Walters, Colin Helms,

Angela Cheng, Janet Lee, ??

Our designers are Mike Femia and ??

Our fact-checkers are Joe Isaac,
Paul Durbin ??, Lorena Aviles Trujillo

and Brian Gutierrez.

Thank you so much for listening.
We'll be back next year.
