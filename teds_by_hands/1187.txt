Adam Grant: Alright, Geoff,
start with your name and occupation.

Geoff Nunberg: My name is Geoff Nunberg.
I'm a professor and a linguist.

AG: How in the world does a linguist
end up writing a book about assholes?

GN: Well, who better than a linguist?

AG: Heads up: this episode
is going to use a lot of that word.

GN: Linguist.
AG: No, not that one.

GN: Bounder.
AG: No.

GN: Cad.
AG: No.

GN: Heel, phony.
AG: No and no.

GN: Those words all articulated
a certain sense of the moral life.

And "asshole" comes along
and kind of displaces them.

AG: Today, we're talking about assholes.

GN: Somebody who cheats on his wife

but not necessarily
on his expense reports.

The asshole is somebody whose efforts
to expand and swell

his own sense of privilege

is hurtful to others:

the other employees,
whose work he takes credit for,

the secretary who he has
picking up his laundry, whatever.

(Music)

AG: Look, I know it's not a polite word.

But it's not going away.

And neither are assholes.

And the word itself evokes a feeling in us

that something tamer
like "jerk" just doesn't.

So we're going to use the word,
because that's what the pros do.

Bob Sutton: I said, "I want
to use the word 'asshole,'

and you would never publish that
in 'Harvard Business Review.'"

She said, "Try me."

(Theme music)

AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

I'm an organizational psychologist.

I study how to make
the people you work with not suck.

In this show,

I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people,

because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

Today: assholes, a field guide.

Everyone's worked with at least one.

How do you deal with them?

And is it possible to create
an asshole-free office?

(Music)

Thanks to Bonobos
for sponsoring this episode.

(Music)

So, apparently there's a difference
between being an asshole,

an asshat and an assclown.

Yep, the Oxford English Dictionary
has recognized all three.

But "asshat" and "assclown"
don't have the same sting.

They're mostly synonyms for "obnoxious."

An asshole is someone who disrespects
and demeans other people

and either denies it or just doesn't care.

Think about the assholes
you've had to work with.

How did they show it?

Sometimes, it's passive-aggressive:

stealing credit,
doling out blame unfairly,

invading privacy, breaking promises.

Other times, it's active-aggressive:

badmouthing, screaming, ridiculing.

Bob Sutton: My father used to say to me,

"When you grow up,
whatever you do, don't be an asshole

and don't work with them
and don't work for them."

AG: Meet Bob Sutton.

He's an organizational
psychologist at Stanford.

He's become something of a connoisseur
of assholes at work.

BS: An asshole is somebody
who leaves you feeling demeaned,

de-energized and disrespected --

somebody who leaves you feeling like shit.

AG: In 2007, he wrote
a whole book on assholes,

and, well, he touched a nerve.

BS: I got thousands of emails

from people who felt
as if they were victims of assholes.

AG: Turns out,
workplaces are full of them.

And through his research,

Bob has learned that it's pretty tough
to be an asshole to the people above you.

Being an asshole has to do with
how you treat the people across from you

and especially below you.

BS: Abuse does seem to roll downhill.

When I looked at my emails
and also the research,

in about 80 percent of the cases,

the person who was named
as the asshole in their life

was their immediate boss.

AG: The more Bob heard
from employees and leaders

about the impact of this kind of behavior,

the more he became convinced

that it must have an actual,
measurable cost.

BS: Just in the last decade,

studying all forms
of abusive behavior in the workplace

has become sort of a growth industry.

And if you and I started
doing the list of all the costs

that nasty people impose
on the people around them,

both the fiscal and mental health costs,

it's just stunning.

AG: One notable experiment
was done with medical teams in Israel.

Each team had a physician and two nurses
from the newborn intensive care unit,

and they were brought in
to work with a visiting expert.

Some teams were randomly assigned
to be berated by the expert.

He told them he wasn't impressed
with the quality of medicine there,

and they wouldn't last a week
in his department.

After being insulted like this,

the accuracy of the team's diagnoses
was almost 20 percent lower.

And the procedures they did
were 15 percent less effective.

I'm guessing you wouldn't want

a 15-percent-less-effective
heart transplant.

BS: I mean, this is one
of the biggest problems

with treating people like dirt:

they're less likely
to call out errors done by others.

AG: To avoid mistakes,
people have to communicate,

especially about things
that might go wrong.

An asshole creates an environment of fear,

where people stay silent
to avoid rocking the boat.

And if getting demotivated
isn't bad enough, get this:

working with an asshole
literally makes you dumber.

BS: There's some evidence

that after one has been
abused or disrespected,

that one's cognitive ability
is temporarily affected.

AG: One experiment
is especially revealing.

Students showed up for a study,

only to learn that they were
in the wrong room

and had entered a professor's office.

For some students, the professor
just directed them to the right room.

The other half of the time,
the students got this:

(Clip) (Door opening)

Professor: Excuse me, can't you read?

There's a sign on the door

that tells you the experiment
will be in room 123,

but you didn't even bother
to look at the door, did you?

Instead you prefer to disturb me
and ask for directions,

when you can clearly see that I'm busy.

I'm not a secretary here,
I'm a busy professor.

(Door slams)

AG: What an asshole!

The poor students who were randomly
assigned to that treatment

were then asked to solve some anagrams.

And they solved a quarter fewer
anagrams correctly.

Then the students saw someone
drop a bunch of books.

The ones who had just been verbally abused
were nine times less likely to help.

Assholes undermine our ability
to think clearly and creatively.

But what seems absolutely damning

is that they also leave us with more
negative attitudes toward others.

BS: Prolonged bullying
turns other people into assholes,

so it's a contagious disease that spreads.

AG: Of course, everyone has a limit.

At some point, people just give up.

They quit.

Occasionally, they even get revenge.

BS: There's research
from fast-food restaurants

that when people have an abusive
supervisor running the restaurant

that employees are more likely to steal.

AG: (Laughs) Although,
if they're stealing fast food,

they're only punishing themselves.

BS: (Laughs)

(Music)

When I talk about the cost
of assholes at work,

there are people who push back.

They say, sometimes you just need
to be an asshole to be successful.

And there's one example
that pops up every time.

Let's call it "the Steve Jobs question."

Recently, I had a chance
to sit down with someone

uniquely qualified to weigh in on it.

Walter Isaacson: Well,
he was a deeply spiritual,

very intense person,

who had rough edges
and was nasty at times and mean.

AG: This is Walter Isaacson.

He wrote the definitive
biography on Steve Jobs,

spending countless hours with him

and hundreds of people
who worked closely with him.

WI: When I started
working on "Steve Jobs,"

Woz -- Wozniak -- said to me,

"The main question you have to answer
is: Did he have to be so mean?"

AG: "Ruthless," "deceitful," "cruel" --

these are words that have often
been applied to Jobs,

very frequently by his closest friends.

Early on, Jobs screwed his cofounder
out of a big bonus and lied about it.

He screamed and swore at colleagues,
belittled employees

and harassed interviewees
by asking about their sex lives.

This kind of behavior was what led Jobs
to get forced out of Apple --

his own company -- in the 80s.

Take it from one
of his longtime collaborators,

Apple engineer and designer, Jony Ive.

He told Walter Isaacson
that when Jobs got frustrated,

his way to achieve catharsis
was to hurt someone.

According to Ive,

Jobs felt he had a liberty
and a license to do that.

WI: Working with him,

you know, I was subject to watching him

sort of, have that
very "mercurial" personality,

as he put it.

AG: I think we both know
a fair number of entrepreneurs

who have held Jobs up as their role model

and said, "Look, he wasn't
the nicest guy in the world.

And that's proof that this is
sometimes how you have to be."

Did he succeed in spite of
or because of his cruelty, in your view?

WI: I guess my answer, in retrospect,

is no, you don't have to be that mean.

You don't have to be cruel to people.

AG: There's a huge difference
between being demanding

and being demeaning.

Being demanding is having
extremely high standards

and pretty low tolerance
for work that falls below them.

Being demeaning is devaluing
other people as human beings,

treating them with such disrespect
that they feel worthless.

WI: When I asked Steve,
"Did you have to be so mean?

Did you have to be so cruel to people?"

He said to me, "You know,
when people do something that sucks,

I just have to tell them it sucks,

because I'm just a middle-class kid,

trying to make sure I don't have
B players on my team.

And so I can't afford
to be gentle and nice."

AG: Research suggests that leaders
who demean their employees

have learned to rationalize aggression.

They see that it sometimes
gets short-term results,

while the long-term damage
is often invisible to them.

So they justify it as necessary
to achieve their goals.

Which means, if you think you have
to be an asshole to be successful,

you might be an asshole.

(Music)

When you've had to deal
with an asshole at work,

what have you done?

If you don't have the power
to get rid of them, what should you do?

Sometimes, you just have to learn
how to have a hard conversation.

Sheila Heen: Yeah.

AG: You're a lawyer
by training, aren't you?

SH: (Laughs) Do you mean
am I an asshole by training?

Yes, yes I am. (Laughs)

AG: Sheila Heen is a recovering lawyer

who teaches negotiation
at Harvard Law School.

She cofounded a company
that specializes in conflict mediation

and coauthored the book
"Difficult Conversations."

Basically, Sheila's job is teaching people
how to deal with an asshole --

and how to avoid acing like one.

SH: Part of the job of lawyers in society
is to help people with conflicts.

And the way that we / they
sometimes go about it

often ends up escalating the conflict
rather than helping resolve it.

And that's essentially the definition
of asshole-like behavior.

AG: But sometimes the conflict happens
because one person is just an asshole.

How often is that the case
in your experience as a mediator?

SH: Well, it is true
100 percent of the time

that each side would say
that the other side is being an asshole.

(Laughter)

We all hurt each other, upset each other,

embarrass each other

in front of other people, publicly --

just misstep and contribute to the other
person feeling really badly treated,

sometimes in ways that we don't intend,
usually in ways that we don't intend,

but occasionally in ways
that we do intend.

AG: Sheila has three key recommendations
for having that conversation.

The first is to give the other person
the benefit of the doubt.

SH: People will say, "You know,
you just have to assume good intentions."

And I think that often that's true.

But I think assume good intentions
is just a little too strong.

I think instead it should be:
assume you don't know.

And that's the conversation
that we need to have,

because I don't know what was up with you,

but whatever it was, it's a problem.

So let's figure that out
and see if we can fix it.

AG: That's fantastic.

Yeah, because that motivates me then
to go and find out whatever I'm missing.

I'll go and try to learn:

What were you thinking?
What was your intent?

What was going on in that situation?

That's really helpful.

SH: I love the orientation
that that just created for you,

which is that now you actually have
a little bit of curiosity.

And so the conversation isn't about,
you know, letting her have it

and straightening her out

and letting her know
she shouldn't be an asshole next time.

The conversation is about,

"Now I'm just curious
what was going on with you,

because I was surprised by it,

and we should address it

so that we just won't have
this problem next time."

That's an orientation that is much more
likely to produce a better conversation

and to solve the problem,
if it's solvable.

(Music)

AG: But Sheila, if you think
someone is just a total asshole,

how should you deal with them?

SH: The dilemma is that the worst
thing you can do, in many ways,

is to do nothing over time.

But the second worst thing that you can do

is to fight back in the moment.

They've been playing that game,
if they're a certified asshole,

for a very long time,

and so you are agreeing to basically
play the game on their turf.

But as soon as you are able,

whether that's an hour later
or the next morning,

you come back to them
to have a conversation.

AG: Sheila's second tip
for talking to office assholes

is to make sure you don't put them
on the defensive.

SH: What you're going to want
to say to them is something like,

"I don't know why you feel the need
to undermine me or demean me.

I don't know why you feel the need
to humiliate everybody

and control everything."

That's what you want to say to them.

AG: Wait -- I'm not supposed to say that?

SH: You can say it in your head.

And you can say it in front of the mirror,

if it will make you feel better.

But what you're doing is,

you're telling them something
about their intentions

and their character,

and you can bet that they're
going to argue with you about that.

What they can't argue with
is about the impact that it's had on you.

So, the most important thing
is to separate intentions and impact.

AG: Sometimes assholes aren't aware
of the impact of their own behavior.

SH: We know what we're trying to do
to get our point across.

What we don't see and people
sometimes don't share with us

is just how upsetting, demeaning,
unprofessional it was,

and the ripple effect that it had
throughout the team and the organization.

AG: Sheila's third suggestion
is to help them find a less demeaning way

to accomplish their goals.

I once worked with a colleague

who was known to yell at people
occasionally in meetings.

The first time I saw it happen,

I called afterward to explain that I found
it disrespectful and unprofessional.

My colleague said,

"Well, it was necessary
to get my point across."

And I realized this was someone
who had rationalized aggression.

I wasn't sure what to do at that point.

So I asked Sheila how we should think
about responding in a situation like that.

SH: If you want to use
a little bit of humor in that moment,

if you can think of it,

when he says, "Yeah, people feel that way,

but that's the only way
for me to get my point across,"

you can say, "Really?

It was my impression that you were
smarter and more creative than that,

so I bet you could come up
with ways to be just as clear,

without having to actually
rip somebody else apart.

But maybe I'm overestimating you,
maybe that's not true."

(Laughter)

AG: Oh, I love that.

So I could actually gently give them
a better way to accomplish their goals.

SH: Yeah, it's a little ...

The story in their head is,
the ends justify the means. Right?

"It was important for me
to get my point across,

and if some people's feelings were hurt,
boo-hoo, that's not as important."

OK.

I actually am going to challenge
whether that's true.

AG: Sometimes, you can
use humor to challenge it

without even saying a word.

Back in the 1990s,

the CEO of a tech company, Gordon Eubanks,

was known for an unusual brand of insult.

Gordon was working to grow Symantec
into a Fortune 500 company.

And for some reason,

he had a habit of comparing people
unfavorably to vegetables.

Mark Bailey: "That guy's dumber
than a head of lettuce."

(Laughter)

AG: Mark Bailey was working
for Gordon at the time.

Did he have other vegetable phrases?

MB: Yeah, he would refer to
a zucchini as well,

but the head of lettuce stuck.

That was the one that I remember
him using pretty regularly.

You knew exactly what he meant
when he said it.

He did not think highly
of the person when he said that.

AG: Was it always about a person,
sometimes about an idea?

MB: It was usually about a person.

AG: After everyone on Gordon's
team had been compared

to a farmer's market's worth of produce,

they finally decided to do something
about their boss's behavior.

So Mark and his colleagues
went grocery shopping

before their next staff meeting.

MB: We arranged it so that we were all
gathering outside the conference room,

and then Gordon shows up for the staff
meeting and kind of growls,

"How come everybody's
not in the room, yet?

Are we going to get started?"

We all nod and then we let him
walk into the room first.

AG: Gordon stepped inside

and saw that every seat
at the conference table

was occupied by a head of lettuce.

Some of the lettuce heads had mustaches,
some were wearing sunglasses.

What would you do if you were Gordon?

When people get called on bad behavior,

there's a real risk
that they'll get defensive

and start calling people names
worse than vegetables.

MB: And when he comes in and sees
all the heads of lettuce on the table,

he just starts to laugh out loud.

(Laughs)

And we all got a big laugh out of it.

AG: What was so clever
about the heads of lettuce prank

is that it was nonthreatening.

And Gordon realized
that Mark wasn't just playing a prank.

He was also making a point.

Gordon Eubanks: He thought it was funny
and probably would be helpful.

It would unite a group of people.

AG: And maybe most importantly,

Gordon ended up
reflecting on his behavior.

GE: Well, I'm sure people would think,

yes, I was probably really an asshole.

If you mean if someone can be very
difficult and unnecessarily abrasive,

I'm sure there were times
when that happened.

I've mellowed, of course, over the years.

If someone steals your parking place,

that's a different kind of an asshole

than someone that's trying
to achieve something

with a group of people.

Demeaning, though, is wrong,

and I'm sure there were times
I was demeaning.

And that's a problem in an organization.

(Music)

AG: Yep, demeaning is a problem.

What if you could
get rid of it altogether?

Is it possible to create
a workplace with no assholes?

(Music)

More on that after the break.

(Music)

OK, this is going to be
a different kind of ad.

I've played a personal role
in selecting the sponsors

for this podcast,

because they all have
interesting cultures of their own.

Today, we're going
inside the workplace at Bonobos.

(Music)

D. Fooks remembers the first time

Carla and her husband Aaron walked into
his Bonobos shop in Scottsdale.

Carla was on a mission.

DF: She was on the hunt
to really trim down his pants.

AG: She had been in the store before

and told D. she was trying
to change her husband's look.

But he wasn't having it.

If she ever got him in there, Carla said,

she and D. had to team up
and seize the day.

DF: Carla loved for Aaron to wear
some of the brighter, more fun prints.

Aaron was a little more conservative

and liked some of the more plain patterns.

So there was that fun
little battle between them.

AG: Carla won.

And that first visit
was the beginning of a routine.

Aaron and Carla would go golfing together,

grab some lunch

and then come into Bonobos and shop.

DF: They'd always have
this playful back-and-forth,

and there was always that fun exchange
of Carla pushing the boundary

and Aaron realigning and resetting
where that line is drawn in the sand.

AG: Everyone in the store
loved watching them together.

They seemed like a real team.

DF: You know, when you see a couple
who loves each other that much,

it gives you hope in more ways than one.

And I think they had an effect
on all of us in the shop.

AG: There's evidence that customers
find ongoing service relationships

more satisfying than one-off encounters
with a different provider each time.

But building that relationship
isn't always easy.

At Bonobos, the guides in their shops

are encouraged to make
meaningful connections with customers,

while of course respecting
their boundaries.

As Aaron and Carla became regulars,
they developed a real bond with D.

DF: It extended much more
than just a customer.

They were kind of like family, in a way.

AG: But sometimes,
even regulars take a break.

Months went by where D.
didn't see Carla and Aaron.

He didn't really think too much of it.

Then, one day,
Aaron walked into the store.

DF: He had come in and said,
"Hey, I haven't been in in a while.

I kind of wanted to get resized
because I've lost some weight."

AG: D. went to pull up
Aaron's purchase history,

which was under Carla's name.

And he suddenly had a sinking feeling
about why Aaron was shopping alone.

DF: It was almost like
a crazy, crazy feeling,

just dawned on me.

I feel like I intuitively just knew.

And everything in me just kind of dropped.

AG: Carla had passed away
a few months earlier of breast cancer.

It had been quick -- only a month
after she was diagnosed with a recurrence.

D. offered his condolences
and asked Aaron how he was holding up.

DF: You know, he smiled,

and it was one of those where you can tell
there was some pain behind it.

But to feel his strength
and to feel his positive energy

was indescribable.

AG: Aaron was just there
for some everyday shopping.

But he happened to mention that he had
a black-tie event later that week.

He'd lost a lot of weight
so his tux didn't fit,

and he was just going to rent one.

After Aaron left the store,
D. leapt into action.

He had noticed Aaron admiring
a particular tux --

the Capstone Italian Wool in navy.

So he rush-ordered the tux
as a surprise gift to Aaron.

It arrived on Aaron's
doorstep the next day,

along with a letter
signed by everyone at the store.

That afternoon, D.'s phone rang.

DF: "Hey, how's it going, Aaron?"

And his response was,
"What do you mean, how's it going?

Man, I can't believe you guys did this."

He was just floored.

It was one of the most
heartfelt thank-yous

I can remember ever getting in my life.

AG: It's what you do, D. says,
when you believe in the idea

that customer relations
really are about just that --

a relationship.

DF: We hope that you'll get, you know,

at least put a smile on your face
for even that split second.

So, it was just something that felt right.

AG: Bonobos makes great clothes
that can fit every guy.

I'm always shocked
when I hear stories like these.

Cindy Hess: The partner was really upset
and took his briefcase,

he was enraged and threw it
against the wall.

Made a dent in the wall.

(Clip) Woman: I had a manager who told
junior members of the firm, verbatim,

"You should spend your 20s sucking up
and doing your manager's work for them."

AG: My students have had
to work with some real jerks.

(Clip) Man: My boss's boss once punched me
in the chest and publicly berated me

for not wearing the correct hat outdoors.

Asshole.

AG: After decades
of working with companies

and combing through the research,

Stanford's Bob Sutton eventually concluded
that assholes make us all less productive.

BS: Organizations that don't hire
people who treat others like dirt

and who call out one another
when they act nasty,

they're more effective places
and they're more humane places to work.

AG: So Bob decided
to put a stake in the ground.

As the expert in the field,

he's called on organizations to set
a zero-tolerance policy

for demeaning and disrespectful behavior.

No bullying, no sabotage.

A "no asshole" rule.

Luis von Ahn: I love
this rule, I live by it.

AG: This is Luis von Ahn.

LvA: In general, in a company,

it's better to have a hole
than an asshole.

So it's better to not have --

if there's an asshole, it's really better
to just not have the person there.

That basically means, don't hire assholes
or you should fire assholes.

AG: Luis is the CEO and cofounder
of a company called Duolingo.

It's an app that gamifies the process
of learning a new language.

It has more than 300 million users,

and it can teach you practically
every word you need to know

in French, Korean, Navajo ...

even Klingon.

Well, almost every word.

LvA: I'm not sure how to call
somebody an asshole in Spanish,

even though it's my native language.

AG: It's not "pendejo"?

LvA: So, "pendejo" is very Mexican.

I'm from Guatemala.

In Guatemala, we use "cerote,"
but that's very regional slang.

AG: What about French?

LvA: I would not know
how to do this in French.

I'm too remedial for that in French.

AG: Well, I heard there's an app
that could fix that.

(Laughter)

LvA: In Duolingo, we do not
teach the word for asshole.

AG: Duolingo is not just
a hugely popular app.

It's a highly desirable place to work.

In 2018, it was named one of the best
workplaces by "Inc." magazine

and one of the top company cultures
by "Entrepreneur" magazine.

When Luis and his cofounder
were launching the company,

they were very conscious
about being anti-asshole.

LvA: He said, "I mainly just want to have
a place where I go to work every day,

and I'm really happy to go to work.

I just want to look forward
to go to work."

That made a lot of sense to me,
and that is what I strive for.

AG: Luis is a computer scientist.

Earlier in his career,
he invented reCAPTCHA.

It's that little box on a website

where you retype
the squiggly letters you see

to prove you're a human and not a bot.

The purpose was to protect
websites from abuse.

Now at Duolingo,

he's determined to build a culture
that protects employees from abuse.

LvA: I have made this mistake
many times in my life,

where there really is somebody
that's just like, brilliant.

But really, they're an asshole.

What I have found over time
is that generally you can find somebody

equally as brilliant who's not an asshole.

As I get older, I just have much less
tolerance for assholes than I used to.

AG: So, Luis and his cofounder have tried
to keep assholes out of the front door

through their interview process.

Did you get it wrong early on, at all?

LvA: Yeah.

It is not the case that no asshole
has ever worked at Duolingo.

AG: So how did the false positives
sneak in the door?

LvA: Well, it's hard,

particularly when you start hiring
more and more people.

At first, you can hire people
who you either directly know

or you know somebody that knows them.

Eventually, you start hiring
randos off the internet

that apply to work at your company.

And it's much harder to know
whether they're an asshole or not.

It is rare that anybody will tell you,

"Do not hire this person,
they're an asshole."

That is rare.

That almost never happens.

AG: When you're hiring,

one of the weak links
in the asshole filter is referrals.

Job applicants get to pick
their best references,

people who have seen them
in a positive light,

people who want to help them,

or in the worst case, get rid of them,
by foisting them on someone else.

But when talking to references,

you can learn to ask
the right kinds of questions

and spot the nuances in the answers.

LvA: A really great question is,
"Do they work well with others?"

Nobody tells you, "No,
they don't work well with others."

That's rare.

The answer you want is,

"Oh, my God, yes,
they're great at working with others."

That's the answer you want.

The one you don't want is,

"Yeah, um ... for most people, they are."

Like, that -- that means,

"Nah, they're actually not good
at working with others,

and they've had trouble."

AG: I've found that you can get
references to be more honest

by forcing them to choose
between two negative qualities.

What's more likely:

that this applicant
will be a total pushover

or maybe a little manipulative?

LvA: Hiring mistakes,

where you hire a person
that you shouldn't have hired,

are significantly more costly
than the other way around,

which is, you didn't hire somebody
you should have hired.

Those are mistakes, too,
but they're not very costly.

(Music)

AG: Here's a question:
in your team, what's more productive:

replacing an average performer with a star

or replacing a toxic worker
with an average one?

One study looked at
the performance and turnover

of more than 50,000 employees.

It turned out that just replacing
a toxic worker with an average one

can be twice as profitable
as upgrading an average one to a star.

LvA: I don't think I've ever come across
somebody that is so brilliant,

so irreplaceable,

that it can justify them being assholes.

AG: So you wouldn't hire a Steve Jobs?

LvA: Well, I think Steve Jobs
was an amazing founder,

I don't know how good
as an employee he would be.

My guess is, he'd probably be
a shitty employee.

AG: Who knows whether Jobs
would have been a good employee.

But one thing seems clear:

he probably would have been a vocal one.

And giving employees a voice

might be just the thing
that workplaces need

to truly lock out assholes.

CH: It really gives them a chance
to feel empowered and to be empowered.

AG: This is Cindy Hess.

She's a partner at a law firm.

And one day, she got
some unexpected feedback.

CH: OK, so the envelope comes,
it's a sealed envelope,

you open it up, there were
boxes to check that said,

"Would you want to work
with this person again?"

And I think one person at least said,

no, they wouldn't want
to work with me again.

And my heart sunk when I saw that.

"Oh, gosh, what have I done
to make that person feel that way?"

AG: The anonymous person
who filled out this form

was a junior associate
who reported to Cindy

and apparently thought she was selfish.

CH: I was nice when I needed to be nice,

took interest in somebody
when that would serve my needs,

but maybe that was transparent,

that I wasn't being genuine
in that interest.

AG: So I have to ask you, then:

Do you think that in the past,
before you got this feedback,

you were kind of an asshole?

CH: (Laughs) Well ...

I guess I would say that sometimes

I didn't act in the best way.

AG: So do you think other people
called you an asshole?

CH: Maybe. I hope not.

(Laughter)

AG: So I will say,
by my definition at least,

I think you are not an asshole.

CH: Thank you.

You know, I think my reviews
have gone way up,

because I really realized
that the behavior I was exhibiting

wasn't always the best behavior.

And so I changed it.

AG: Unfortunately, many people
aren't as open to feedback

and course correction as Cindy.

If you want to stop
the assholes in your office,

you have to address the thing
that lets them get away with it --

the reward system.

It's a mistake to just incentivize
individual achievement.

You have to reward and promote people
who elevate others,

rather than undermining them.

which means paying special attention

to how those in power
treat those who lack it.

To prevent bosses
from acting like assholes,

you have to give subordinates power.

When I gave a talk
at Cindy's law firm, Fenwick & West,

I discovered that they have
some unique tools for doing this.

They actually let junior associates
pick which senior partners they work with.

CH: It's truly a free market.

When you're a partner and you have
a new client coming in the door

and you need to staff it
with an associate or two,

you have to go and ask people,

and it's across the entire
corporate group.

For example, I'm a corporate partner,

so I would go and ask various associates
to work with me on that client.

And they have the unfettered
ability to say no.

AG: Which means that
when a partner is a "bosshole,"

word spreads fast.

CH: Associates are going to choose
to work with the people

that they enjoy working with,
who they're going to learn from,

who are going to mentor them,

who are going to take
an interest in their career.

And those people
who don't act in that way,

those partners who don't act in that way,

are going to have a really difficult time
getting their matters staffed.

AG: So that means, if there's a partner
I think is an asshole,

I can just choose not to work
with that person?

CH: That's exactly right.

AG: That's amazing.

How do I get that job?

CH: Yeah, and we've had situations

with partners with a significant
amount of business

saying, "I want to have a designated
group of associates to work with me."

And the firm said, "No.
We're not going to do that.

We're not going to modify
our free-market approach

because you're having a more
difficult time getting your work staffed."

AG: To make sure leaders know
how they're being viewed,

they do anonymous upward reviews,

where junior associates
rate senior partners --

which doesn't happen in many law firms.

CH: When I was interviewing
with law firms,

I could tell when a law firm
was really catering to a star.

I remember being a first-year associate
and I would see big corner offices

with vestibules to get into that office,

like of the secretary.

You could tell that those
were the sorts of places

where they were really catering
to particular partners

who had a lot of power.

AG: Assholes thrive
in certain kinds of workplaces --

places where leaders say
they want teamwork,

but only pay and promote
on individual results.

The classic term for it is "the folly
of rewarding A, while hoping for B."

For one example, look at a company
that was huge in the 90s.

(Clip) Man: It starts with good people.

AG: Its stated core values
were communication, respect,

integrity and excellence.

(Clip) Man: There probably are times
that there's a desire to cut corners,

but we can't have that at Enron.

AG: Enron may have claimed
to value good behavior,

but they actually rewarded
ruthlessness and selfishness.

BS: One of my favorite
diagnostic questions

that I like to ask in organizations is,

"Who is a superstar here?"

AG: Psychologist Bob Sutton again.

BS: And if the superstars are
pretty consistently people who are jerks,

people who are takers,

that's a sign to me that the game is
that those people are getting rewarded,

despite the rhetoric.

It means that they're forgiven,

and to me, that's the real test.

AG: Most important question.

BS: Yes, sir.

AG: Do you believe that there is
such a thing as an asshole-free workplace?

BS: No.

AG: Damn it! (BS laughs)

Damn it.

You asshole! (BS laughs)

BS: I think --

AG: I was really hoping
you would tell me there's one.

BS: I think there are workplaces

where there's very few
or maybe no certified assholes,

but there's always going to be
some temporary jerk behavior,

just because we both know
it's so easy for us

to accidentally leave people
feeling disrespected.

We're going to be tired,
we're going to be grouchy, in a hurry,

somebody's going to yell at us --
it's going to happen.

But the difference is,

what happens when there's a transgression?

AG: When the belief that it's necessary
to be an asshole doesn't get challenged,

behavior often becomes normalized,

not only by the perpetrators,
but also by victims and witnesses.

Here's conflict mediator,
Sheila Heen, again.

SH: The people who say it's actually
a big plus to have an asshole

in your organization,

the people who would say
the no-asshole rule produces cultures

that are very polite but are not
as dedicated to excellence or quality,

part of what they're
identifying is this tension,

which is that in polite cultures,

if our main goal is not
to hurt anybody's feelings,

well, then we don't actually
give each other feedback

or point out, "Actually we could
be doing this a lot better."

And so things get driven underground,

and it takes an asshole
to come along and say,

"What are we thinking? This is stupid."

Right?

AG: Do you think that workplaces
should have no-asshole rules?

SH: Do I think workplaces
should have no-asshole rules?

Yes.

If the implicit rule
behind the no-asshole rule is,

"nobody should ever feel upset,"

that's not really a workable rule.

I think, in workplaces, the rule should be
that how you treat people matters.

A lot.

And it doesn't mean that we won't
sometimes have hard conversations.

AG: I think every leader
has a responsibility

to strive for a no-asshole culture.

It's the smart thing to do
if you want to attract,

motivate and retain talented people.

But more importantly,
it's the right thing to do.

We spend so many hours at work,

and we have a right to be treated
with dignity during those hours.

So, screen assholes
out of your hiring process.

Make sure you don't reward
people who get individual results

at the expense of others

and create a toxic culture.

And when someone is demeaning,

see if you can find a respectful way
to let them know what impact they've had.

If you don't have the power
to remove or reform an asshole,

your best bet is to minimize
your interaction.

And if that isn't an option,

you can at least control
how you view that person.

Bob Sutton has a colleague
who has some fun with it.

BS: He pretends that he's
sort of an asshole specialist,

and he just considers himself really lucky
to see this spectacular, amazing specimen.

AG: Are you deliberately avoiding
using the word "asshole"?

CH: (Laughs) Yes, I am, actually.

I don't think I want to use it.

I just think, if my mother
ever listens to this podcast,

she wouldn't appreciate
if I use that word.

AG: ... as opposed to my last interview
who said "asshole" every four words.
