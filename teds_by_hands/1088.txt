Parenting and technology.

Parents are full of questions
about the digital future.

What’s good or bad technology?

What will help or hinder their child?

These are not easy questions to answer,

and our society is struggling with them.

I’ve always been fascinated
by how families embrace new technologies,

perhaps because
I was brought up by a mother

who wouldn’t have any technology
in the house at all.

When I became a social
psychologist in the 1980s,

I began asking families
about what was new.

Then, it was “where to put
the home computer?”

“Should children have
a television in the bedroom?”

Parents were worried
about violence and advertising.

And they weren’t sure
what the benefits were going to be,

but broadly they were optimistic.

Fast-forward 30 years,

and the world has changed.

Digital is everywhere,

and now parents’ hopes and fears
about digital technologies

are almost overwhelming.

They are eager to discuss everything
from screen time to gaming,

from pornography to coding.

But why are we so fascinated
by the digital?

Lots of other things have changed
in recent decades,

which have added to our anxieties:

uncertain work,

changing forms of family,

increasing inequalities,

intensifying educational
pressures on our children.

But when we look back at our childhood,

and then at our children’s,

it’s the digital that symbolizes
the change between then and now.

All those devices in our homes:

we love to talk about them,

but we feel we should
be able to control them.

Here’s Lara and Pavel.

They’re from different
countries and cultures,

and they’re making their life
together in London.

They’re arguing about what
digital technologies

their six-year-old son,
Thomas, should use.

Lara, originally from Brazil, is excited.

Pavel, from Poland,

he’s worried.

But more fundamentally,

they’re arguing about
how their lives should be in London

and who their son Thomas should be.

Should he be open to change,

or should he be cautious
in the face of risk?

I want to argue

that the digital has become the terrain
on which we are negotiating who we are:

our identities,

our relationships,

our values

and our children’s life chances.

No wonder our anxieties and arguments
about technology are often so fraught.

Society has high hopes

and considerable fears
for digital technologies.

And that adds to our anxieties,

because what parents want
are practical steps that they can take

to shape their children’s
digital lives positively.

So how can we better parent
for a digital future?

Well, I’d like to suggest
as a starting point

that we recognize
and not underestimate the efforts

that parents are already making,

and then think about how society
can support them better.

Let me tell you a little about
my recent research.

With my co-author, Alicia Blum-Ross,

I’ve been interviewing families
in London from many walks of life.

I’ve interviewed them
at home when I could,

or in a café,

or while they’re waiting for their child
to come out of coding club.

And I’ve asked them to reflect
on their parenting --

to think back to how they were brought up,

and to look forward
to their child’s future.

Parents told us lots of different stories.

Some of them were finding life hard,

and we had some tears.

A fair few wanted
to talk about the risks --

and those are important

and they deserve attention,

which they get elsewhere,

including from me.

But some --

and this may seem more surprising --

some were calm and confident
about their children’s digital lives.

And today, I want to tell you
what I learned from them.

The first thing I learned
from the families

who were calm and confident
about their children’s digital lives

is that they were clear
about their values.

And they found ways
to live close to their values

and to include the digital
technologies in those

so that the digital is not
something weird or contradictory

for their way of life.

So Daisy and Jacob live on a low income

and they have an art background,

but they value creativity.

Their small flat
is full of papier-mâché projects

and crafting and photography materials.

And Daisy curates computer games
that express her alternative aesthetic,

including those which resemble
the art of Escher.

Leila is a single parent,

and she’s also on a low income,

and with health worries.

Like many migrants,

Leila values education.

And her family has helped her
buy a computer

so that her daughters
can do their homework on it

and that she can help them
in their digital aspirations.

Ryan and Amy are committed to helping
their son in any way that they can.

Kyle has moderate to severe autism,

and at 13, he’s become passionate
about digital design.

His parents now use their media expertise
from their profession

to support his interests
in any way that they can.

Dani values the digital for itself.

She’s excited about a digital future.

She thinks that geeks
will inherit the earth,

and she’s enrolled 12-year-old Josh
in a course for computer programming,

saying that coding Java is the new Latin.

The second thing I learned
from the families

who are calm and confident
about their children’s digital lives

is that they share 
the decision-making within the family.

They negotiate;

they don’t impose.

They listen to their children's views

and they even share
some digital pleasures together.

So Dani loves it when Josh
invites his friends around

and they all play “Minecraft” together,

and she sets them coding challenges

and then enjoys watching
their collaborative problem-solving.

Ryan and Amy take their lead
from their son.

They go out and take
digital photos together

that he can use in his design projects,

and they see a special affinity

between his educational needs
and the digital world.

Jacob and Daisy understand

that their children
will play computer games --

standard, commercial computer games
with their friends.

But they’re glad that they’ve added
some alternative games into the mix,

and feel that way
they are sharing their values.

And Leila, well, she doesn’t understand
much about the computer,

but she loves that 10-year-old Nareen
can fix it for her when she needs it.

And she uses it so that the family
together can listen to music from Ethiopia

and she can share her home culture
with her daughters.

I’m not saying that a digital future
is the only or the best way forward

for these children.

I’m saying that their parents
have good reasons

for supposing that it might be.

And I’m also not saying
that sharing their values

and listening to their children
and their interest in technology

is going to solve
all of family’s problems --

of course it won’t.

But I think it can help,

because it means that families don’t have
to fight against the inevitable,

because the digital is not going away.

And it means that parents
don’t have to try

to do the same as everybody else,

but they can play to their strengths.

But it’s hard for them.

The digital future
raises many uncertainties.

Should we all be building robots
with our children?

The digital future --

it raises hopes and doesn’t explain
the steps we need to take towards them.

It promises outcomes
that might not materialize,

and it intensifies the risks 
and opportunities that we all face.

So how can we help parents better?

Well ...

we could stop scaremongering.

We could stop telling parents
to police their children.

Parents are trying to live
democratically with their children.

They don’t want to police them,

spy on them

or ban their pleasures.

How does it help
the families facing difficulties

to demand that they control screen time,

on top of everything else?

Why undermine the efforts of parents
who are trying to do something creative

or educational with technologies --

to treat all screen time
as if it’s the same?

Official screen time advice
is causing conflict in the home.

And there’s no solid evidence

that more screen time
causes more childhood problems,

especially by comparison with social,
economic and psychological challenges

that families are facing.

Indeed, restricting children
breeds resistance

while guiding them builds judgment.

So we should be helping parents
to develop that judgment,

to evaluate what's on the screen,

to think about how their children
are interacting with the screen

and to think about
what they’re getting from it.

We can also require our schools

to embed digital literacy
in the curriculum,

and to reach out to make connections
with families’ digital lives at home,

outside the classroom.

Librarians, youth workers,
health visitors --

they could all be supporting parents
to make more educational and creative

and imaginative choices
about the digital world.

And government could play its part
in addressing the risks

and ensuring an abundance
of positive content

for families to engage with.

Of course, the digital is not everything,

and we also want
more public parks and clubs

and places for children to go
and meet their friends face-to-face,

and for families to be able to go out
in a way that’s affordable for them.

Society is investing
a lot in a digital future.

But it’s still parents
who are the main influence

on their children's life chances,

and there’s no quick fix
for the challenges that they are facing.

When it comes to technologies

I’ve suggested that for parents,

it will help if they can be clear
about their values,

listen to their children

and share some digital
pleasures with them.

For society, I know it's easy
to criticize parents,

but I’ve argued instead that we should
recognize the challenges they’re facing,

that we should try to enhance
the opportunities

and options available to them

and that we should ask ourselves
how we can support them better.

Thank you.

(Applause)
