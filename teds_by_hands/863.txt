Design matters will be back in a few weeks
with a season of new episodes.

In the meantime, we wanted to replay this
interview from October of 2017.

This is Design Matters with Debbie Millman
from design observer Dotcom.

For 13 years now, Debbie Millman
has been talking with designers

and other creative types
about what they do,

how they got to be who they are and what
they're thinking about on this podcast.

Every morning talks with author

and researcher Brittany Brown about
belonging, courage and vulnerability.

The very first thing I look for
in you is vulnerability.

And the very last thing I want to
show you is my vulnerability,

vulnerability, shame, failure.

These aren't the things we like
to think about in ourselves.

But for Bernie Brown, they are the focus
of her attention as a research professor

and business leader. She has studied how
being vulnerable could make us more

courageous and empathetic, more
true to our humanity.

In her new book, Breathing the Wilderness,

Bernie Brown calls on us to
move closer to each other

because people are hard to hate, close
to speak truth to bullshit,

but be able to hold hands with strangers.

And she's here today to talk
about her brand new book,

her career and the TED talk
that changed her life.

Bernie Brown, welcome to Design Matters.

I'm excited to be here. I listen
to you all the time,

so it's really fun to be across from
you doing this. Oh, ditto. Yes.

Bernie, is it true that when

the movie Grease first came out all those
decades ago, you saw it 25 times?

So I was trying to remember exactly.

So I went with the most conservative
number that we could come up with.

But yes, like, oh, yes, I
used all of the money

I had saved up all my Christmas birthday
card money. I saw it at least 25 times.

Was it because of Olivia Newton, John
John Travolta? What was the allure?

Was it the two of them together? I
don't even think it was that part.

It was the singing and the dancing and
like this is going to be high school

and I can't wait.

You know, you and John, I think
was my first crush.

I went and saw her when she was still a
country music singer back in the 70s,

70s, late 70s. Yeah, yeah.
I totally get it.

I think it was that I think, you know,
I started smoking. Yes.

I actually read that you wanted to be
Olivia Newton John with a cigarette

and a catsuit winning over John Travolta.

Yeah. I mean, I just thought,
you know, and, you know,

until I watched it maybe ten years ago
with my daughter, who's now 18,

so maybe she was probably
10 or 11. We watched it.

So maybe eight years ago, seven
years ago, I was like,

this is completely inappropriate.

You we have to shut this thing off,
cover your eyes. Yeah.

Because the moral of the story is like,
don't be the good girl.

Get the catsuit, buy a pack of marbles.

STOCKARD Channing rolled in. Oh yeah.
And so oh I loved it. And I aspired.

Oh, I wish my listeners can see
your face right now. Your

eyes are sparkling now.

You were born Cassandra Briney Brown. Yeah
. In San Antonio, Texas.

But you moved to New Orleans,

Louisiana when you were very young
and you've described your mom,

who you are named for, as outspoken
and tenacious. In what way?

So, yeah, my mom and I
are both Cassandra's

and she goes by her middle name and
I go by Bernie, she you know,

we move to and this is recent history,
which, you know, we're not that old.

But when I started kindergarten
in New Orleans,

1969 was the first year of
mandatory integration.

They you know, I think the laws that
come down maybe a decade before,

but they just weren't acting on them.

So this is when the judiciary said you
will integrate your schools and.

My mom was a very outspoken
around racial issue,

so she wrote an open letter to

the Times-Picayune against what we
would call racial profiling.

Today, she was just very.

Outspoken in a time where people were
not especially white woman,

and she was also rather crafty,

I understand she may view herself

and your Barbie matching yellow
plaid shift dresses. Yes, I.

Please tell me you still have them.

I don't have the dresses,
but I have the pictures.

I have boarding a train and she's holding
my hand and I'm holding my Barbie

and all of our dresses match. Yeah.

So I just thought of her as like,
you know, my mom, my crafty mom.

But I knew and other adults
got around her.

They they could look at her like
she was a shit starter.

So she really had it all going on. Crafty,
smart, vivacious.

So you take back to your mom.

I see. I do a little bit. Luckily now,
from what I understand,

you when you were little, there was
a time when you wanted to be

a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. Oh, my God.
Where'd you get your research?

That's terrible. It's true, but it's
terrible. Well, it's true.

It was followed by a short period of time
when you dreamed of driving an 18 wheeler.

Yeah, because we had a CB and once we were
proficient enough on the language,

we were allowed to talk on the
CB during family trips.

So I would say, like we go back and forth
to San Antonio from Houston all

the time. And so I'd say if we are going
to if we were going to San Antonio is

a breaker one nine four. Eytan,
East Border,

how's everything looking
over your shoulder?

Because we'd be looking for police and
so they would say everything's clean,

green, you got to smoke at mile marker 29.

So like, as long as I could understand and
be fluent, I was allowed to use it.

So I was like, I think I just do something
where I can just talk on this

for a living.

I would give just about anything right now
to be able to talk on a CB radio with,

you know, the last thing I want to ask
you about in terms of what you were

aspiring to be when you were a child,

was that when you were in middle
school inspired by

the television show Love Boat, you wanted
to be a cruise director like Julie.

You're staring at me with hatred. I did.

So Dallas Cowboy cheerleader, truck
driver or cruise director. Yeah.

I mean, like, you know, look.

What we see matters, so we hear all these
debates about inclusively on television

and seeing people in jobs like
that should matters.

What I saw were Dallas
Cowboy cheerleaders

because we watch football all the time

and there were no female there's no
Captain Stubing was not a woman like

on the Love Boat. It was just the cruise
director telling people where

the parties were or whatever.
And so that's what I saw.

And so that's what I wanted to do.

So until you discovered Eleanor Roosevelt,
man, and she changed her life,

that changed everything. Yeah. What
happened? How did that happen?

I just remember that my parents
were hosting a bridge party.

So all four of us, the kids were upstairs
and there was a PBS special on.

And we were allowed we were never
allowed to watch television.

We could watch television. We could watch
two shows a week. What did you watch?

Love Boat? Well, Love Boat was later,

but we were Young Mutual of Omaha's Wild
Kingdom, too. Yeah. And Disney.

Marlin Perkins. Right. Yeah. Oh,
I loved him. Yes. And Disney.

So there was a PBS special on

on Eleanor Roosevelt and it was kind of
all know rules that night because of

the bridge party downstairs.

So I watched it and I was like,
she's a complete badass.

And I can't believe she put up with
all the crap she put up with

and why wasn't she president?

And I think she was pissed off
that she wasn't president.

And I even like her more now. So that
kind of shifted everything.

Then I became much more aware.

You left New Orleans for Houston, Texas,

when you were in the fourth grade and then
you left Houston for Washington,

D.C. when you were in the sixth grade in
eighth grade, he moved back to Houston.

That must have been really hard for you.

Is terrible. I was always the new girl
and I never it was terrible. Yeah.

I think that's why writing a book on
belonging seems so natural to me,

because I think I could mark the times,

mark the calendar of my
life by not belonging.

And so, yeah, it was really hard.

I mean, just think about
this now as a parent,

I think about moving fourth grade,
sixth grade and eighth grade.

And the hard thing about the Houston move
is we moved back to Houston and

I went back into the same school
I was in in sixth grade,

but I had been gone for two years.
Everybody's friendships had developed.

Oh, yeah. Like my friend group
had nothing to do with me.

And I had been living in Washington,

D.C. So I was a little bit more ahead
in terms of like how I dressed and

I would go to bed and I put like a hundred
little braids in my hair and,

you know, wake up and wear
it really big and curly.

And people were like, oh,
where is she from?

After the final move back to Houston,

your parents marriage began to seriously
disintegrate as well.

Yeah, and it was also at this time,
at the very end of eighth grade,

after eight years of ballet,

you tried out to be a cheerleader on
the drill team on the drill. Yes.

So that's a slightly different
type of its the best cadet.

I just want you to picture white
leather cowboy boots,

a blue short little satin skirt with
white friends, a white cowboy hat,

and then everyone had a short wig that had
like flipped out Doris Day hair. Oh.

In their natural hair color. And then
you had to wear a standard issue.

Cherries in the snow, Revlon lipstick.

So in your amazing new book,
Braving the Wilderness,

you wrote that to this day,

you're not sure that you ever wanted
anything in your life more than you

wanted a place on the drill team.

And being on this team was about
belonging personified.

Can you share with our listeners what
happened in that experience without

giving too much away? Because, yeah,
it's such a great story.

It's such an amazing story.

No, I think, you know, we
had just moved back

and we moved back like two days
before tryouts or something.

Like we were right as tryouts were
starting at the end of eighth grade,

because I think I moved back with
four weeks of eighth grade left,

which was just, oh, my God,

it's like the rules of when not to
move if they weren't around.

Yeah, no, really. Are you there? God,
it's me, Barney. Do not move.

So I said, OK, well, I'll try out.

And then when I had seen them, like they
came in the first day of tryouts,

the whole team and did a routine for us.

And I was like, it's like Greece,
this is Greece,

this is Greece is the ticket to Greece.

And so I just thought and, you know,
my parents were strung out.

They were things were so hard.

My dad worked for Shell and they'd been
moving us around a lot. It was hard.

And I was the oldest of four.

And things were just getting more and
more tense at home, more fighting.

And, you know, back then
you didn't talk about

I didn't know anyone whose
parents were divorced.

You know, all I knew is that my
grandmother was divorced and my mom's mom

and she was also an alcoholic and
my favorite person in the world.

I named my daughter after her.
She was amazing.

But growing up, she was an alcoholic. She
was an alcoholic. She was divorced.

And no one could come to my mother's
house because she my mom had

a divorced mom. Wow. That's all I knew is
that that divorce thing is really bad

and it's, you know, and so here my parents
feel like on the cusp of disaster,

but here of the barricades and
they're so bright and shiny

and just these high kicks, you're like,
what is happening?

This is like this is great. So I go to
try outs and we get the routine.

And it was funny cause when I was writing
the book, I had to I was like,

what is the name of that song?
We tried out too.

And so I went to iTunes to try to find it.

And I was going through all these
different songs and I hit it and it did

the preview and I just burst into tears.
I was like, Oh my God, that's the song.

And you still know the routine. Oh,
I still know the routine.

Yeah, I could probably do
half of it right now.

And it was not it was not a hard routine.

And again, I had been in ballet
for like eight years,

so it was like not a big deal. There
was a rigorous, terrible way in.

And so I remember during the whole thing,

everyone was starving themselves
to death. No one was eating.

Everyone was working out in those plastic
sweatpants and sweat tops.

And so then Tryout Day came and I
got to the gym to try out and I,

I kind of looked around. I was going
out of the car by myself and all

the other girls had spent the night
together the night before,

and they were running in holding hands
and giggling and laughing.

And I got out of the car by myself
and I realized very quick.

Within seconds, all of these girls
were just full makeup, huge hair,

golden golden blue collars, both
gold and blue silver outfits.

I mean, like and I had on a black leotard,
gray sweatshirt, like sweatpants,

material shorts that were
rolled on my leotard

and like just dancing shoes like Jennifer
Beals in Flashdance. That's yeah.

That's what you look at. That's I look
like because it was like, you know,

it's a dance thing. So I just remember
being traumatized, by the way,

because I made the way and by six
pounds because, you know,

for that week I remember girls
screaming and running into

the dressing room with their
hands over their faces

because they didn't make it. I did the
routine. It was easy. It was great.

I could kick higher than anyone. My group,
you know, it was fine.

And then you went home and
you had to wait for three

or four hours until they
posted the number.

You were little number on your thing.

So I get back to the high school and
there's a just a poster board.

And your parents drove you back?

My parents drove me back because we were
going straight to San Antonio to visit

my grandma. And I remember walking
up to the poster board.

I was never 62 and I remember
looking and there, you know,

there are numerical order
like 58, 59, 64, 67.

And I was like, no, no, 58, 59, 64, 67.
I was like, how is this happening?

And I remember this girl named Chris,

who is the shiniest of all girls in eighth
grade, running up, looking at her.

No, clearly seen it screaming and her dad
jumping out of his car and running

and grabbing her and twirling around.

They were twirling around and I was like,
oh, my God, this is not happening.

So I get back in the car and I was crying
and my parents did not say a word.

I know. I know. I couldn't breathe
when I was reading this.

They didn't say anything.

They didn't say anything. Just they
just kind of got really quiet

and looked down. And I think it was so
this is the hard thing about parenting.

The story I made up at the time is my dad
was the captain of the football team

and my mom was the head of her team. And
I think they were ashamed of me.

And for me, like they did
not know what to say,

like my parents had no idea what
to say in that moment.

And so we just drove in and actually
American, Jason, like while a little,

you know, if I was 12, Jason was
eight and the girls were four,

they knew it was hard, but
no one said a word like

for three hours to San Antonio.

And for me, it was a defining moment
because it was like the moment

I no longer belonged in my family. I did
not belong with these people anymore.

Like they my brother was cool. My sisters
were even cool in fifth grade.

They had, you know, and I
was like, oh, my God.

And it's funny because when I talk to my
parents about it today. They just said.

We didn't know what to do.

Like, we they couldn't be vulnerable
growing up to survive.

They came from very hard backgrounds. And
so their story was not Greece at all.

Their story was the opposite of Greece.

But back then, you just
make up these stories.

That's the thing about nobody's life
is Greece. No one's life is Greece.

You know, and I always tell parents,

you cannot control for the stories
your kids will make up.

The only thing you can do is provide
a culture where they can go to you

and say, the story I'm making up right
now is this are you ashamed of me or

for me or everyone's cool here but me.
And so it really defined me.

It was the last thing I ever
tried out for my life.

And so what I did is, you know, fitting
in is imperative in high school.

So, you know, I took to Miller Light
and smoking weed, right.

When he became STOCKARD Channing.

Yeah, I became I found another crew that
did not dance on the drill team.

And it was not great. It was really hard.

And it continued really
through my early 20s.

Well, you go on to right after sharing
this this story with the readers,

how not belonging in our families is
one of the most dangerous hurts.

And it has the power to break our heart,
our spirit and our sense of self-worth.

And that day, all three broke for you.

And I was astounded when I read
the ways in which people,

family respond to this type
of profound hurt.

You talk about how they were really only
three ways we respond to this type of

pain, living in constant pain,
denying pain,

or finding the courage to own
the way we move forward.

Can you talk a little bit about those
three ways of trying to deal with pain

at that point?

Yeah, I think when people experience pain
like that and it's really interesting

because I thought, you know,

this is a book that takes on the
political culture right now.

Today, this is a book that takes on
everything from white supremacy

and Black Lives Matter. Why am
I starting with a story about

the drill team and not belonging other,
bigger, bigger issues to take on?

There are absolutely bigger issues to take
on, but there is no bigger issue,

I think, than feeling for those of us who
feel like they don't belong in their

families or don't belong on the planet,
don't belong on the planet,

because then it's hard for us to
be a part of the resistance.

It's hard for us to speak out because we
don't know and we lose ourselves in

the movements that we become a part of.

And so for me, what I've observed
in the in the data are that

the reaction to pain is one.

I pretend like it doesn't happen until
it absolutely cripples you.

You know, pain is not going
to be ignored and.

In the very end, it will take you down
physically like the body keep score

and it will always win. The second piece
is people who take that pain,

and this is what we see today in the world
, people who take the pain,

the early pain. And they
inflicted on others.

They take their own pain
and their own heart

because it's easier to cause pain
than it is to acknowledge

and feel your way through it,

and then the last one is people who
acknowledge pain worked their way through

and who in response to doing that,

have a very keen eye for seeing pain
in the world and other people.

And I think that was my choice.

And I think the little miracle for me
is that my parents grew with me.

Like, my parents will read every book
and say, God, we didn't know,

and what do you think about this?

And now I watch them with my kids and
they're like, you know, Ellen,

I don't think you should pull that in
on yourself. Don't carry that load.

This is not about your worth. I'm like, oh
, my God, which is great.

But I'm like wary.

But I think those are the only three
options inflicted on others.

Pretend like it's not happening until
it takes you down or own the story

and walk through it.

In many ways, I feel that braving
the wilderness is a bit of

a culmination of of your
previous four books,

and as I was rereading quite a lot of
your books before today's interview,

one of the books that I was really struck
by in how much of that book became

a sort of primer for this book was I
thought it was me, but it wasn't.

And I was struck when I read about your
description of Harvard trained

psychiatrist Dr. Shelley eram
and her work on remembering

the wound versus becoming the wound.

And you wrote how most of the time
when we recall a memory,

we are conscious that we are in the
present recalling something from

the past. However, when we experience
something in the present that triggers

an old trauma memory, we reexperience
the sense of the original trauma.

So rather than remembering the wound,
we become the wound.

And this makes sense when we think of how
often we return to a place of smallness

and helplessness when we feel shame.

How do you get over those initial
life defining wounds?

How do you get to a place of feeling like
you don't belong in your family

and then to a place where you're
willing to look at why

and then feel that you do belong
at some point to the world?

I think the key is owning the story, I
think as long as you deny the story,

the story owns you, the story's
not going anywhere.

So your choices are to pretend like it's
not happening or to own the story

and walk into it.

And when you talk about
becoming the wound,

like when I look at Charlottesville and
I look at those guys with torches,

I see people living a wound and thereby
inflicting pain on other people.

And so I think you either own the story.

And you heal from that story or you
become dangerous to other people.

It seems to be, from my perspective,

so obvious that anybody that has to exert
their power over someone else doesn't

feel powerful enough.

And you just sit on one of the biggest
controversies, I think, in my field,

you know, I'm a social worker
and I mean a social worker,

social worker like bachelor's, master's
and Ph.D. in social work.

That's what I did. And I started
very early in domestic violence

and sexual assault. And there was

a lot of controversy around when you're
dealing with perpetrators of domestic

violence, is that an action
of power and control?

And what I found in my work is that as a
response to powerlessness, not power,

people who feel a sense of power
don't respond like that.

But there is no greater and
more profound danger in

the human experience than powerlessness.

Why is that, because, I mean, how do you
respond when you feel powerless,

like we're desperate? Yeah, I mean power.

I mean, Martin Luther King defined power
is the ability to affect change.

When you're sitting there in Harvey

and you're watching water go lap into your
neighbor's house is coming up your

stairs. It is a sense of powerlessness.

It is a sense of helplessness of you
want to come out of your skin.

And so powerlessness is
incredibly dangerous.

Now, are those people in Charlottesville
really, you know,

are the white supremacists really
powerless to remember majority culture

there? Men? I don't know this for sure.

So I'll just say hypothetically,

I make up their mostly straight
and Judeo-Christian.

So what their narrative of powerlessness
is, I don't know.

But that's when people become dangerous.
That's when people are really dangerous.

And I think what we're seeing
right now in the culture.

Not just from this administration,
but around the world,

is power over is absolutely
making a last stand.

Power over is absolutely saying this
is the way the world has been since

the beginning of time. We are not going
to go to a model of shared power.

We are defending the paradigm
of power over at all costs.

What made you decide to write a book
like this, I think belonging,

obviously for obvious reasons,

is something that's always been
very important to me.

I thought I covered it and the
gifts of imperfection.

I didn't know I'd come
back and revisit it,

but I was going through kind of my own
metamorphosis around belonging.

I was starting to finally understand what
it meant to carry belonging in my heart

and not to negotiate it externally
with other people.

It wasn't there there shot to call
whether I belonged or not.

It was my shot to call. And so I thought,
let me look back into it.

I was in it for five minutes before

I realized that you can't
write about connection

and belonging without talking about
the real political world today.

And so it was not my intention to wade
into politics and what's happening.

But you have to follow the data
when you're a scientist

and that's where it went.

You call yourself a grounded
theory researcher,

which you've described as developing
theory from people's lived experiences.

So it doesn't it doesn't feel like a big
stretch to actually be looking at

the way in which people are living
their experiences now.

Now, it's it's you know, it's interesting.

Just a quick story I think you'll love.

This grand theory was developed by
Glaeser and Strauss in the 50s,

and they needed to find a methodology to
talk to children who were dying about

the fact that they were dying.

But they couldn't ask them what they
thought because they're back then,

there was a a pact made between physicians
, nurses,

parents and clergy to not let children who
are dying know that they were dying,

why they thought they couldn't handle it.

They could have thought they couldn't
handle their prognosis.

And so these researchers were
stuck and they thought,

we want to study dying in children,

but we can't ask them what
it means to die.

So we're just going to come up with a
methodology that is rigorous based

on people's lives, experiences.

But we're not going to ask them anything
but tell me what's going

on in your life. And if what we want to
study is not a priority for them,

then we won't take it on because that's
this is people's lives experiences.

So they would sit down with
children and say,

tell me about your tummy while
you're in the hospital.

And one after one, the kid said, I'm dying
, but it must be really terrible.

No one will talk to me about it. Hmm.

And so grounded theory evolved
as this methodology

for studying hard topics where
researchers don't.

If I sit down with you and said.

Tell me how you negotiate belonging with
people who you disagree with politically,

there's so much loaded in that question
that what I'm getting back

is very prescribed.

So I just say, you know, tell me about
your family and your friends after

the election and then we build it from
there and then we test it quantitatively.

You've stated that grounded theory
is really controversial in

a lot of academic arenas. Why is that?

The methodology is not controversial.

The methodology is a super rigorous
and very difficult.

In fact, most of the time
we try to tell people,

you don't want to do it for dissertation
because it's long and hard.

I mean, we don't use any technology
so we could all data by hand.

So I have 200000 pieces of data
we've collected over 17 years.

What's controversial are the findings
because we are not proving kind of

the dead white guy theories out there.

We're really asking people what
it means in their lives.

And so the theories that come up are hard

because it calls into question
traditional research.

You mentioned Bernie Glaser, one of
the founders of Grounded Theory.

He calls it the drug last trip.

And it said that you have to have
a real comfort with uncertainty

and vulnerability to do
this kind of research.

And you define vulnerability
as uncertainty,

risk and emotional exposure.

And when you began studying vulnerability,

your own conflict with it became apparent
and you recognized you were,

in your own words, judgmental,
perfectionistic,

all work and not only no plan, no rest,

but a kind of disregard for play and rest.

And the people who thought
it was important.

Was this an attempt to understand
yourself what caused

the spiritual awakenings breakdown
you referred to in your first

TED talk in 2010?

Now, I think what happened early on
is I was trying to figure out

the anatomy of connection.

What do men and women who are
connected share in common?

And I remember it was a very Jackson
Pollock moment because Steve took

the kids to San Antonio
for the weekend and

I had like 50 big poster size Post-it
notes all over my house.

And I was coding this data and I was
going through and I end up with

a list of kind of the whole hearted men
and women do this and they don't do this.

They do this, but they try to avoid this.

And then I looked at the don't like the
shitlist and that described me to

a T. like, you know, try to be cool,
try to be perfect,

try to derive your status from how
exhausted you are or how hard you work.

Like all these things just described me.

And so I thought, oh, my God, I think
they describe everybody I know.

Yeah, I'm on the wrong end of
the research stick people.

And it was at that moment then you
decided to seek help for yourself

and figure it all out. Yeah. Why
therapist So why do we do that?

Why do we use these outside badges,

this social cachet to buie ourselves
up in the eyes of others

or in doing what we think
Bui's ourselves up.

Yeah, I mean, it's a culture status thing.
I mean, exhaustion as a status symbol.

I think because we just desperately want
to be seen, we desperately want to belong.

We want to believe we're lovable
in the absence of connection,

there's always suffering. So
we want to feel connected.

You said that we're living
in a scarcity culture

and that many of us feel that we'll never
be thin enough or rich enough

or safe enough or maybe exhausted
enough or successful enough.

And the number one casualty of a scarcity
culture is vulnerability.

Why is the opposite of all of these things
, this social cachet,

this out external meaning, this external
validation, the opposite of vulnerability,

because vulnerability at its heart
is the willingness to show up

and really be seen.

No armor to really be seen when
you can't control the outcome.

And so every one of those things
on the shitlist, the judgment,

the perfectionism, the work that's trying
to control perception of Instagram,

yeah, Instagram is trying to you know,

it's trying to control how we're perceived
, where vulnerability is.

This is who I am. And just in openness
with that and. OK, yeah.

Always willing to get better and change.
But this is this is the flaws.

This is me.

I for many, many decades really tried
to hide how not only how much shame

I felt about sort of living, but
my failures, my rejections,

as if somehow if I revealed that that it
would mark me, it would damage me,

I would become Hester Prynne and yeah.
Never be loved again. Yeah.

But I think it ultimately came from not
ever feeling love to begin with.

And what is so powerful is the one thing
that we all have in common is

the fear that you just named that it is
the paradox of vulnerability that when

I meet you, the very first thing I
look for in you is vulnerability.

And the very last thing I want to show
you is my vulnerability. Right.

So I'm desperately seeking yours while
hiding mine. What are we so afraid of?

People seeing an lovability.

It's rare to meet someone that
you can see immediately

as someone who's had good parenting,

because ultimately I think good parenting
is what makes you feel lovable in

the world. It has very little
do with anything else,

at least from my perspective.

So I think it is key. And I think I
think the mistake that we make is,

I would say with very few exceptions,

ninety nine point nine percent of

the parents who raised all of us were
doing the very best they could

and probably 10 orders of magnitude better
than what their parents did.

But the belief that we have
to change is that.

Because someone didn't or couldn't
love me. That makes me unlovable.

That's that's the big mythology.

And regardless of someone's ability
or willingness to love you,

whether it's a partner, a parent,

it has really no bearing on your
love ability whatsoever.

And to take that on to our load.

That's what changes the trajectory
of people's lives.

Yeah, and if somebody does love you,

you there's this crazy paradox
of why do they love me?

And they need to keep proving that
they love me or they love me.

So they must not be so great. It's
like the Groucho Marx thing.

I don't want to belong to a club that
would let me in. Right. Yeah.

And so and that's you know,
when I started first,

Steve was the first person I felt like who
really saw me, like really saw me.

And he caught the tail end of, like,
self-destructive wild Bernie.

But he saw me and he came from really
similar hard parenting,

kind of a lot of divorces.

And we we were the first people we
talked to about those things.

But he really he really saw me.

And I remember six months
after we got married,

I was in the therapist's
office and I was like,

this is not going to work at all. Like
he's just bugging the shit out of me.

And I don't think I can stay
married to him at all.

And she you know, we had several
sessions and she's like,

I think you're right about Steve.

I'm like, yes, I know he likes you
so much more than you like.

You know, as I'm sorry. She's like, yeah,

she he just likes you so much
more than you like.

You must be a lot of conflict
like you. You're fired.

Yeah I, I underline that in the book,
so it's a wonderful story. Yeah.

I was like, you're fired.

I got there eventually a Maya Angelou
quote figures prominently in

the narrative of braving the
wilderness in a come from

an interview she did with Bill Moyers.

And I was wondering if you could read
it today to us on the show. Yes.

So she says you are only free
when you realize you belong.

No place you belong every place, no
place at all. The price is high.

The reward is great.

Now, this is a line that actually really
bugged you for a long time.

And I know you spoke to Steve
about it at length. Yeah.

This thing was like a cross in your side.

It was totally stuck in my craw. I
was like, what does that mean?

You're only free when you belong
nowhere and everywhere.

I'm calling bullshit on that. Like,
that cannot be true.

Like as someone who crave belonging,
I'm like,

there's no freedom and not belonging.

Like, that's been that's been like
a jacket, not freedom for me.

So there was this moment where
I was sitting with Steve just

a couple of years ago and I was going
through a big stack of speaking request

and one of them said. Please come speak
at our church, we really love you,

there'll be 3000 people in the audience.
It'll be amazing.

We know you're folksy down home. The only
thing we ask is that you not cuss.

It'll offend the faithful.

And I was like, I want to
say what I said to that.

But that would actually offend possibly
the faithful. But I was like, why?

I'm the faithful like like and then in

the same stack like to request
deeper in the stack.

It said Fortune 100 company,

because I do like 90 percent of my work
on leadership and culture development

and people don't know that. But that's
where I spend most of my time.

And they're like super excited to
have you come in and talk to

the leadership team about your work.

We saw you speak at this retreat.

We love what you're saying about
vulnerability and innovation and art

and creativity. It's super important
for our business right now.

You did mention that your two values that,
you know, lead you are faith and courage.

And we're wondering if you could admit
the faith part and just talk about

the courage part, because in
the corporate setting,

we don't talk about faith.

And I was like.

And I look at Steve and I still, you know,

I can't like forty forty ninth time 49,
I still belong nowhere.

Like am not a church speaker completely
not the church speaker.

I'm not the leadership speaker because
I talk about feelings and faith

and things that are important to us. I
you know, I don't belong anywhere.

And he's like Qabbani. Everywhere you
speak, you're like the top rated speaker,

like, what is that? What's, you know,
like you belong anywhere that you go,

as long as you yourself.
I'm like, maybe I mean,

I guess I guess I belong everywhere.
I belong.

Along everywhere, I went nowhere, holy
shit, the Maya Angelou quote, I was like,

Oh my God. So I grabbed my laptop,
I searched it, I read it to her.

And he's like, yeah, that
makes sense to me.

I mean, it wouldn't make sense, but
I think that's true of you.

Then I Googled. The interview
with Bill Moyers,

because I'd never seen the whole thing,
just that clip,

and so the next question he asks
after she says this is he says

so really you don't belong anywhere.

And she pauses for a second and says, no,
actually, I belong to Maya.

And I like Maya very much, and I was like,
oh, my God, I want to belong to Bernie.

And so I went back to my study and said,

I'm not looking to this thing for a minute
and he's like, I ordered dinner,

I'll make dinner. We just start and
I'll yeah, no, you make dinner.

He's like, I'm going to order dinner.

Because the last time you said this,
it took two years.

So I'm going to go and order dinner.

And so that's when I started
the research on belonging.

Yeah, I love that she she says
I like Maya very much.

I like the humor and courage very much.

And when I find myself acting in a way
that isn't that doesn't please me and

I have to deal with that.

Yeah, I love that. I love so. Well, I.
Yeah, yeah.

The experience of learning into that quote
motivated you to start this body of

research that allowed you to start
developing this book and

the theory of true belonging. Yeah.

And I was going to ask if you could share
that with us as well, Bernie. Yeah.

So the theory of true belonging
to true belonging is

the spiritual practice of believing
in and belonging to yourself

so deeply that you can share your most
authentic self with the world

and find sacredness in both being a part
of something and standing alone in

the wilderness. True belonging doesn't
require that you change who you are.

It requires that you be who you are.

Stunning. Thank you. I think I need
to have that tattooed on my heart.

Why are so many people so afraid
of being alone, Bernie?

I think people are afraid to be alone
because they don't belong to themselves.

And so one of the things that was

so crazy to me about this research in
these findings was that true belonging

is not just about being
a part of something,

but also having the courage to stand alone
when you're called to stand alone,

when the joke's not funny, when you
don't believe in something,

when you have a different opinion,

when you're at a family dinner

and people are saying things that you
actually find hurtful when you're called

to stand alone and you can't, then
true belonging is very elusive.

So your level of belonging
will never exceed

the level of courage you
have to stand alone.

And that was a new thing for me,

and so I think I'm in a place in my life
right now where I'm not afraid to be

alone because I so fully belong to me now.

I call what we're in right now a spiritual
crisis of disconnection

and people get nervous about spiritual
practice and spiritual crisis

because they're like, oh, not religion.

Isn't that why we're in this
mess to begin with?

And this has nothing to do with religion
or dogma. When I say spiritual, I mean.

Spirituality, I define spirituality,

is the belief that we're inextricably
connected to each other by something

bigger than us. Some people
call that bigger than God,

some people call it fishing.
Some people call it art.

But spirituality's no more no less than

the belief that we're connected to each
other in a way that's unbreakable.

You know, you cannot break the connection
between human beings,

but you can forget it, and we have
forgotten that inextricable connection

between human beings. And so when I am
alone and standing up for something that

I believe in, I know you can't do
anything to permanently break

the connection between me and
everyone else in the world.

But I know I'm called to
courage to stand alone.

I think people who forget that we're
inextricably connected actually feel

completely not just alone, but lonely.
And I think that's the difference.

How do you hold on to your vision of
what is right and just and noble in

the face of other people's rejection

or discontent with whatever
it is you stand for?

I mean, this is why I called
the wilderness.

I mean, every poet, artist, musician,

theologian has used the metaphor of

the wilderness to describe
that kind of solitude,

that journey of it's just me and
I don't know what to expect.

I don't know what's coming next. That
inner belief, that inner belief.

And so I think when you're
called to the wilderness.

It's very hard to walk in and stand alone,

but you have to hold on to the belief that
even though you feel like you're

the only one, a lot of us live out there.

And the thing about going into the
wilderness and standing alone

and taking a stand is I think those
experiences mark your heart.

And I think, you know, to me, it's
the mark of the wild heart.

I do find sacred being
a part of something,

but never at the cost of betraying myself.

Your TED talk catapulted you to fame,

but you had already been speaking
and publishing quite

a bit before that in your first book,
the book that I referenced earlier,

I thought it was just me,
but it isn't making

the journey from what people
think to I am.

Enough had been published in 2007,

but you self published it first
as women and came back in 2004

and have written about how
you could wallpaper

a building with your many rejection
letters from publishers.

And I'm not sure that everybody
really knows that about you.

You even borrowed money from your
parents and sold copies of

the book out of your trunk. They did.
What gave you that sense?

I mean, you were deep in the
wilderness at that point.

Oh, my God, I was with you because no
one was talking about shame. Yeah.

And people were like, yeah, back on shame.

Nothing sexy as it sounds
more not interested.

Man One publisher said we're
interested will buy it.

Willing to change the title to women's
most embarrassing moments.

Oh, no, no, no. So what gave
you the power to persevere?

What kept you sure that you
were on the right course?

I mean, I knew like, I, I felt
otherworldly about it.

Like, I mean, I don't I mean, there's a
lot of tears and a lot of frustration,

a lot of crying, a lot of rejection.

And then pinguin I sold enough books out
of my trunk that it got Penguin's

attention. Then Pinguin bought it.
And I may change the name.

And they changed the name from women and
shame to I thought it was just me,

which is great because that's like the
one thing people say when they read

the book. All I thought it was just me
and I had experienced so much shame,

especially at the hands of my academic
colleagues for self publishing,

that when Penguin bought it, I was like,

I will absolutely sever myself from
the vulgar commerce of book sales.

I will not do any kind of
promoting of this book.

I will sit back and wait
for it to, you know,

hit the charts and do everything
it failed.

So I thought it was just me came out two
months later, they called me and said,

how many copies do you want to get?

And I said, I'll take 10 for
my mom and her friends.

Now, I know we have thousands. You're
being remaindered pulped like it's over.

Like it's done. Like you failed.
What did you do?

I will lost my shit at first,
and then I was like,

I can I have a very high tolerance
for risk and failure as long as

I can learn some things. I was like,
what is the learning here?

What is the learning here?

And I think the learning for me was
if you're not going to get excited

and put value on your work,

don't expect anyone else to get excited
or put value on your work.

If you're going to sit back and wait for
people to knock on the door and say,

talk to me about your work, don't do it.
So that was the hard lesson for me.

So I got a chance to redo
it with a paperback.

And the other thing that I thought it
was just me is a lot of people,

it's a lot of people's favorite
books because, you know,

it's but it's very it's all women
and it's thick on Shein.

It's a book just about shame.

Well, you featured four
women in that book.

And I did read the book thinking, oh,
my God, I thought it was just me.

But I have actually been saying
that through all your books,

I almost feel like you write the books
for a specific point in my life that

I am approaching or in the middle of good.

And then there sort of guidebooks to get
out of whatever it is in my way.

You said that courage is more important to
you as a value than succeeding. Yeah.

Was this one you cultivated it coming
out of that hole. Yes. Yeah.

Yes. That and after the success
of daring greatly or maybe

the success of Gifts of Imperfection, I
can't remember which book, you know,

I think there was some pressure to kind
of just do a formulaic, you know,

formulaic books like just keep
doing whatever you're doing.

And I thought I'd rather have a book.

Well, this is the learning from
I thought it was just being.

If I fail wholeheartedly,
I can live with that,

if I fail and I've been half assed,

are half hearted in my effort
that I cannot live with.

I had a student a couple of years ago,

we were talking about the kind
of life we want to have,

and one of the classes that I teach
is called Get How to Get

a Job When You Graduate, Differentiator DI
, How to get a Job and you do it.

And so it's not only about getting a job,

but getting a job that really
means something to you.

What do you feel like you deserve? What
do you feel like you're worthy of?

And I actually feel like I've shown
your 2010 TED talk so often.

I show it in every class that I teach that
I could actually do it if I want.

If you wanted me to. But I won't.
At least not now.

But one of the things that I ask the
students is, what are you afraid of?

What is keeping you from trying
this or doing this?

And one of my students said something
that I've never forgotten.

He said, I'm afraid if I do this and I
fail, I will die of a broken heart.

And I at that point try to bring Dan
Gilbert in, synthesizing happiness in,

but essentially saying, what would you
rather die of regret at not trying.

Yeah, that's much crueler. Yeah.

Any advice for young people that are at
the beginning of their adult lives

and thinking about what they can do with
their lives that can allow them to feel

that courage?

Plan on heartbreak. Yeah, yeah, I mean,
just playing on heartbreak.

The only people who don't have heartbreak
in their careers are people who have

no love or passion for their career.

But heartbreak is, well, miserable
when you're in it,

a small price to pay heartbreaking
criticism,

small prices to pay for doing work that
you're profoundly in love with.

I find the work of people whose
hearts are stretched,

marked and scarred to be far more profound
than clean, shiny new hearts.

Well, I think having experience with
heartbreak also allows you to understand

humanity in a way that you couldn't
possibly if you didn't experience it does

and know going in.

You know, that's wholehearted, right,
that's wholehearted, no going at it,

and that's daring greatly. Yeah.

The only guarantee if you live

a brave life is you're going to
get your ass handed to you

and just know that is part of the process.
Greive have a hard time.

Yeah, I think that's that's
what you have to do.

One of the most significant themes
of braving the wilderness was

the notion of trusting oneself and others.

And I love the quote you included
from Charles Feldman,

who describes trust as choosing to risk
making something you value vulnerable

to another person's actions and distrust

as deciding that what is important to
me is not safe with this person in.

It blew my mind. It really blew
my mind because I think that's

the world we're living in right now. Yeah,
this sense of distrust.

So my last question to you today is this.

And it's I think it's kind of a big one.

How can we learn to be more trustful in
our relationships and in our communities

and in our countries and in our world?
How can we do that?

I think it starts with self trust.

Trust is a big, hard word, and when our
trustworthiness is called into question,

we usually go very Lembeck. We just, you
know, we hear like the peanut's mom.

Like what? Longlong we don't
hear people talking.

So what we did is we went into
the research and said,

when we talk about trust, what
are we really talking about?

And we found the seven elements
that you're referring to.

We use the acronym abrading Boundaries,
Reliability, Accountability Vault,

which is confidentiality, integrity,
non judgment and generosity.

I think we build trust by having honest
conversations about what trust is to

sit down with our families and say people
want to like pull in information,

integrate it, and then slowly
lose it out with people.

Like, they just sit down and say, look,
I read a book.

And in this book it said the definition of
trust is sharing something vulnerable

with you and feeling safe about sharing it
and yaha the people I love the most.

But I don't feel like I can
trust you with my opinions

because they're different than yours.
Can we talk about this?

Like, I don't know what to do, but if
this is the definition of trust,

it's really important that
you and I have this and

I don't feel like we do right now.

And so just having the hard conversations,
that's how I think this starts.

Briney Brown, thank you so much
