And so that was why I was sort of
in support of I hate calling you

the trans man, that just
sounds like so.

Well, I yeah. Matty, would you
what would you call it?

Yeah. I mean, in my mind, I think
that's really what it is.

Hey, I'm Dylan Marron, and welcome back
to conversations with people who hate

me, the show where I move negative online
conversations from inboxes,

comment sections and social media
posts to phone calls.

Now, sometimes I speak one

on one with people who have said negative
things about me on the Internet.

And other times I share this platform with
people who have received their own

digital negativity in this episode.

I'm connecting to people who didn't
know each other before this call.

Their relationship is through me.

My first guest, Tyler Gilmore, is my
husband's cousin and the other guest,

Matty Macara, is the wife of my childhood
babysitter. Why am I collecting them?

Well, it comes down to one topic,

the proposed ban of transgender folks
serving in the military in

a since deleted Facebook post.

Tyler, a veteran of the Marines, publicly
expressed his support of the band.

Maty is also a veteran of the Marines,

and she recently came out
as a trans woman first.

I'll speak one on one with Tyler, then
I'll speak one on one with Matty,

and after that, I'll connect them to
each other. So let's get started.

Hi, Tyler. Hello, how are you? Good, I'm
doing good. You are a veteran? Yes.

And a Marine? Yes. OK, so what made
you want to join the Marines?

I, I mean, there, there's like
a plethora of reasons why

I wanted to join.

I come from kind of like a poor family
and I wanted to explore the world

and get out of, you know, the small
town of Middleton, Idaho.

And I also was kind of like trying to come
out of the closet at the same time.

And so it was like this. I thought
in my head, I thought, like,

if I joined the Marine Corps, you know,
part of me was like,

it'll turn me into a man like,
quote unquote.

And and then the other part
of me was like, oh,

I'll be the first Marine to serve openly
gay. Obviously wasn't true at the time.

I just was unaware. But you
were like. But it was not.

Yeah, I was like, oh, just get that record
. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.

And it was it was a good choice.

I mean ultimately I'm the
first person, you know,

in my immediate family
to even get a degree.

And so it ended up being very, very. Yeah,
very good for me.

What was it like being in the Marines?
It's very intense.

And like right in the beginning, bootcamp
was really challenging.

I definitely cried a few times.

Everybody cries of boot camp and they say
they didn't. And but this is the truth.

Exactly.

And so, like, you know, like middle of
the night, like no one's looking,

you know, like you kind of just like,
you know, you sob. Yeah.

Like like deep, deep sobbing.

So, yeah, it was it was I always
when people ask me,

I always say I was like very intense
with some of the best

and worst experiences of my life. And
it taught me amazing lessons.

I think a lot of times in the United
States we do live in this very small

bubble of like very safe bubble
for the most part,

but going to places like war
torn nations that really

I almost feel like everybody should have
to go and see something like that

because it is so intense and
it is so Eye-Opening.

And it really changes your view

on everything from like how you view
your family to all of your friends,

how you view objects. Like I just don't
view objects the same anymore.

Like none of that seems to matter since I
came back. And you mean like material?

Yeah. Materialistic stuff. Yeah. And I'm
in what's called inactive service.

OK, so if you know shit hits the fan,

they're going to call
back someone like me

and people who have who's inactive
right now. Exactly.

And so what have you been doing
in your inactive duty time?

Well, the first thing I
did when I got out,

I took some college courses when I was in,

I just I was in a combat battalion
and we just could not do courses.

I wanted to do school so
that enough to do it.

So when I got out, I immediately went to
a community college in Bellingham,

Washington. Yeah. And so about, you know,
into my second year of college,

I started applying to schools and
I got accepted into Cornell,

which was across the country.

And I once I got ice cream on my back.
Right. Right, right. Yeah, yeah.

And I packed my bag and my whole car.
My apartment up. Yeah.

And drove cross-country. Yeah.
That's where I'm at.

OK, right now to bring this into a more
macro conversation, July of 2017,

Trump announces the trans
ban in the military.

And your feelings about
that were that tweet.

I was absolutely against the tweet.

Like it's not necessary to say something
like that. So I. I was not for that.

Yeah. You know, is it, you know,

a good thing to have transgenders
in the military?

Does it does it affect the
overall readiness?

OK, so in a since deleted Facebook post,
you expressed support for the ban,

not the tweet, but the ban. Why
why did you write that post?

I saw, like, outrage on the left, right.
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

Like, how dare you do something like that
?

I was annoyed that the left was reacting
like this when there's so when

I felt like they were so opposed to

the military industrial
complex in general.

A lot of my friends on the left are
like just so mad at me that

I could even think that maybe it would
be a good idea to have a ban

on transgenders and. And that was just my
opinion, and I was like, well, I mean,

they're not inclusive and
they're not equitable.

Yes, that's not the point
of the military's point,

is to be a fighting force to kill you when
people started pushing back on you

for that post. How did you start
to feel? I mean, I don't know.

I mean, I didn't feel I wasn't I I mean,
I wasn't upset, you know,

but I was just kind of like.

Like, lay off me, most of them weren't
even military members,

and that's what's irritating.

It was like people who had never
even experienced the military

and have no idea what it's like to
be under the pressure of combat.

And then they're coming at me being like,
we need to do this and this.

And I'm just like, shut the fuck up.

And where do you stand now on it?
Are you pro the trans ban?

I'm honestly just still confused about it.

Like, I, I don't want to be against it,

but and I and I want to be
for it because I want to

I want everybody to feel, you know,
a part of this country.

I don't want them to feel left out.

But it is really complicated because
I do feel like there is

a lot of issues that come
on board with that.

Like I looked up like, how long
does it take to transition?

What are like the what happens
when someone does transition?

I watch a few YouTube videos
and and so my thing is,

if someone comes in and they're trans
with the hope to transition in

the military, that that makes them
inoperable for like six months to

a year is what I read because of,
like hormone treatment.

And then if they get the
surgery on top of that,

then you're getting hormone treatment,
which, you know, affects your brain.

I mean, steroids are illegal
and you can't take those.

And a lot of that is because of
the reactions that you have,

not only like metabolically,

but and steroids are illegal and they
are illegal in the Marines,

in the military in general.
And so that was my thing.

Like, I think it's and then and then
when they're I mean, yeah,

I guess it have a lot of no questions.

And so so but that's what an amazing
place to start. Yeah.

Like questions are are a great thing to
have. So did you know any trans Marines.

Not a single one that I served with.
I never met a single one.

You know, anybody in the Marines know.

OK, so we can change that right now. Cool.
Yeah. Look at you Marines. Yeah. Wow.

Hello. Hi, Maddy. Hi, how are you? I'm
good. How are you doing? Pretty good.

Somebody in only as many details
as you're comfortable sharing.

Tell me about you.

Well, I grew up in a small town in
Massachusetts and a conservative family.

We went to church, a lot of Pentecostal,
a Christian.

And I was this sort of solitary
kid with long hair.

I spent almost all my time either playing
sax and guitar or skateboarding.

Oh, and I use those as like my outlets
for getting my frustration out a lot.

And what are you seeking an outlet from?

I feel like I didn't know myself at all.
I couldn't see myself in the future.

I couldn't see myself in the present.

I didn't really want to go
into college right away.

I was thinking like just an adventure into
the unknown might be best for me

because I am sort of an unknowable person.

So. So I decided to join the
Marines as a musician.

Well, even though I knew almost
nothing about the Marines

and this was right out of high school.

Yep. What was the introduction
to the Marines like?

All Marines have to go through a three
month boot camp, combat training.

So it was a lot of hard work.

Yeah, there's a ton of work, but
it really was an adventure.

I got to travel the country. I became a
leader very early. I was a sergeant.

Oh, wow. Before my 21st birthday. Oh,
my God.

Things that I learned there have kind of
propelled me through the past 20 years.

The core values in the Marines honor,
courage and commitment and integrity.

Those things, especially now I'm really

feeling them at my core and they
define me in a big way. Mm hmm.

How are you using honor, courage
and commitment right now?

I really feel like, you know,

I'm honoring my friends and family and
others out there who have, you know,

struggled with who they are through the
years by being myself now coming out

as a trans woman. It's funny
because sometimes

I think I'm sort of like one of
those Bourne Identity movies

where the government taught
me these values.

Little did they know that one day I
would use them to live openly as

a trans woman.

And, yeah, that's that's
kind of beautiful.

What was the coming out process like?

Well, you know, after I left,

the Marines had an epiphany a few years
ago that, you know, life is really short.

It's about living your life.

That's who you are with integrity and,
you know,

being an example of that for sure, for
your kids. And I have a daughter.

So there was a huge shift in me when I
felt that and I knew I had to come out

and it wasn't even a question.
I just knew I had to do it.

It was a really magical moment, too,

because now it became a challenge and it
was, oh, oh, you think this is impossible
?

Wait and see because, yeah, I am
coming for you life and yeah.

I'm going to slay this thing.

Yeah. Oh my God. That's so beautiful. Wow.

How has it felt to live out loud and
proudly as as a trans woman?

It's been amazing. It was hard going
right up to that moment.

And I, I didn't know how people would
react. I knew people would be surprised.

But I wasn't expecting

to be surprised myself by the reactions
because I just got a ton of support

and love. Hmm.

That's wonderful. A lot of people. Yeah.

People I served in the Marines with.

And then I also was in the
Air National Guard

and people have been amazing.

So last July, when Trump suddenly
announced this trans ban in the military,

where were you when that happened
and how did it feel to see that?

I think I was at work, I think and
I heard the news had sort of

a swirl of thoughts and feelings
in the wake of that.

I served for 16 years in the military, you
know, and that's not a small thing.

So, you know, I come from it.

I come to it from that perspective
and know everybody thinks of

the phrase once a Marine, always a Marine.
If you're a Marine, it's the.

Because it's almost like
an unsentimental fact.

Yeah, it's just it is what it is, just
like you are a Marine. A Marine.

Yeah, that's that's just the way. It's
just a fact. So, you know, the.

The placement I have in my heart.

For the Marines.

Is right next to the place
I have in my heart,

where I feel in my core that I'm trans.

Yeah, and there's sort of like two sides
of the same coin because, you know,

the courage and integrity I learned in the
military are things I use every day.

Hmm. And that have really given
me the opportunity,

I feel like to me to do this thing now.

Did you interact with any people
who vocally supported the ban?

No, I really haven't done that.
I've steered clear of that.

So you are about to talk to someone
who did, at least at one point,

vocally support the trans ban.
How are you feeling?

I'm feeling pretty good. You know, it's
a little nerve wracking, I guess,

because I don't really do that,

like talk to people and about issues like
this and sort of steer clear of that.

And, you know, I do kind
of take my example,

just like being myself and and being in
in the lives of my friends and family.

That has some effect that I hope. Mm hmm.

Well, do you do you feel ready to have
this conversation? Yeah, I think so. OK.

All right. Well, let's do. Great.

Hi, Maddie. Hello, how are you, Maddie?
Can you hear us at an OK level?

Yep, you sound sort of reverby,

but it's probably like a speakerphone
or something.

We are on speakerphone, but it's
just for recording purposes.

Are you OK with that?

No, I have to back out.

I'm sorry. OK. All right. Well,
thank you so much.

So to kind of kick things off, Maddie,

can you talk to Tyler about your history
and time in the Marines?

Sure. Join the Marines and ninety seven.

And I had a unique job in the Marines as
a musician, but went to boot camp,

combat training, everything Marines do.

So, you know, in a single day,

we could spend hours on a really delicate
piece of music and then go and,

you know, firearm training, gas chamber,
you know, physical fitness.

But it was a lot of hard work.

And now, just so you can hear, Tyler,

tell me about your experience
in the Marines.

Sure. I was 35, 31 motor vehicle operator.

And so when we deployed, we did route
clearance, we did security,

we did logistics.

You know, a lot of it was just like
prepping a lot of convoys, a lot of like,

you know, weapons, maintenance
and training and, you know,

probably a lot of the same
things that you did.

Gas chamber, too. What does that mean?
That sounds terrifying.

If you wanted to take out that.

What what's that?

Well, I mean, gas chamber training,

you go and you're in this enclosed
space and they released tear gas

and you have to do a series of things.

And if you do them correctly, then and
you get out of there, you'll be fine.

You'll get to it. But if you can't
operate your gas mask correctly

or you don't breathe, you know, as
you should make you nervous,

then a few seconds after getting in there,
you're crawling for the door.

Yeah, that's that'll fuck you up. So, OK,
this is great to know.

So I also now wanted to bring up you both
very bravely came out as identities,

one of which was not and one of which
now is not necessarily welcome in

the military. Tyler, I want to start
with you. You came out as gay.

Yeah. Yeah, I did. I remember when Don't
Ask, Don't Tell was repealed.

I was deployed and it was right then. Yeah
, it was.

And somebody ran up to me with a newspaper
that had this image of

a male Marine jumping on another
male marine kissing him. Yeah.

And the Hawaii hangar bay. I remember that
. Yes. It was an iconic photo. Yeah.

Then I tried to come out and my best
friend at the time, he abandoned me.

I mean, he stopped being
my friend entirely.

And this was in a combat environment.

Well, and I just went into like
a very deep depression and

I didn't want to come out then when
I came back out of deployment.

I just couldn't I like wanted to come out
and don't ask, don't tell was repealed,

so I knew I would. Yeah, so and just
so people know how that works.

Don't ask, don't tell was a policy
implemented by Clinton. Yeah, right.

That was saying you're welcome to
be gay in the military as long

as you don't tell anyone.

I think that's I think that's a little bit
too generous that way too generous.

It was like during, during when don't
ask don't tell was was in place.

People were getting kicked
out quite often,

like I remember even being in when
it was don't ask, don't tell.

I remember them like my sergeant coming
out and just saying, like,

if if if any of you guys get caught,
you know, no, no.

We're going to find you faggots like blah,
blah, blah. Oh, fuck. Oh yeah.

And he's like, even though it might be
repealed here in the next couple of years,

I just know that if we catch you, you know
, being a fag before then,

then you're out.

And I remember like my my fists,
like my palms like sweat.

And I was just like, oh
my God, oh, my God.

I mean, so this is a really important
thing we're hitting on right now,

which is that like policy is affecting
how people are treated.

Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

So Mattey, you were serving in the time
when Don't Ask, Don't Tell was law, right
?

That's right. What was the kind of
vibe under Don't Ask, Don't Tell?

I did actually have very close friends in

the Marines who are gay to either told me
at the time or later, were they nervous?

We didn't talk about it. Yeah, right. But
that's the name of the policy. Yeah.

Yeah.

How have you been treated as a gay Marine,
both in the Marines and and beyond?

When when I did come out, obviously
the first time in Afghanistan,

it was like, yeah, it was bad.
It was not good.

That was when the losing a friend,

losing and losing a friend
was not it was not ideal.

Then then when I came out in Hawaii,
when I got back,

it was actually like one of the most
beautiful experiences of my life.

I yeah, I came out to my my like one of my
best friends and he looked at me and

it was just like the sweetest. They
just like had this smile.

And it is like to be like, well, yeah.
And I was like, yeah, I'm gay.

And he was just like like, why didn't you
tell me? Like, I am I the first person?

And I was like, yeah, he's like, well
thank God. Like that was all.

He was like, yeah, you'd be
the first person. Yeah.

And then the rest of my and
then of course you know,

they're Marines and I know
that he knows about this.

Like they asked the most inappropriate
questions you could possibly imagine,

you know, like do you like to take it up.

But yeah, blah blah blah blah blah,
all that stuff.

And I would answer and then like
most thoroughly disgusting

and descriptive ways that they
would feel uncomfortable.

You're going to ask me that question.
You're going to get the fucking answer.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah. Yeah.

But no, I mean overall it was
very well received and I had

I felt more love from my command
for coming out than

I did from sadly my own family.

I love them, you know, but like
that's really how I felt.

I felt like they were much more accepting.

So Matty, I know you didn't come out as
trans when you were in the Marines,

but once a Marine, always a Marine.
So you came out as a Marine.

So what was your coming out
process after the Marines?

I was in the Air National
Guard for twelve years

and it was even after that.

And I came out, but I just sort of I
didn't think I could ever come out.

It didn't seem like anything I
could even fathom happening.

I just thought, you know, people would.

Lose their minds, basically.

And one skill I learned in the
Marines is to suck it up.

Nobody ever told me that explicitly, like
there wasn't a drill instructor.

I said, if you think you're transgender.

Right. Right. He did call us ladies a lot.

And you were like, OK, I'm into this.

It's the nicest thing they
ever said to me.

Yeah. And so the reason we're
on this call is that in in

a since deleted Facebook posts
that I actually haven't seen,

Tyler wrote in support of the trans men
and then got a lot of pushback. So.

So, Tyler, why did you delete. Yeah,
that's a good question.

I felt honestly, I felt like this
is going to be brutally honest.

I'm like applying for jobs and

I really didn't want this to be something
that inhibited my ability to get

a job. Sure. I basically
said that I thought

I thought it was ridiculous that

the left was kind of arguing in favor of
having trans people be able to serve

when they're so ardently against the
military industrial complex in

the first place. And then later on, like,
you know,

people commented back on their, you know,
like I was a bigot and stuff like that.

And that's when I started getting into
more intricate arguments in the comments,

which were like, well, what
about the Rand report?

We all know the comment section is

the greatest place to have nuanced
conversations. Yeah, right. Really nice.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

But I guess my my thing was like I
thought about when I came out in

the Marines and when I was deployed
and there was a point when I was

so depressed that I wanted to kill myself.

And I thought, what if someone was
transitioning when they're in

the military, you know? So I mean,

even if they're not deployed like you're
in the Marines to marry, like,

you know how stressful the
Marines is in general.

So I thought, like, what would
that have been like?

Because arguably, like coming out
as trans, especially now,

is much more challenging than
coming out as gay, like.

And so that was that was what I what
why I was sort of in support of of

I hate calling it the man that
just sounds like so I mean,

like I mean but I feel like it is.

Well, I yeah. I mean, I think. Matty,
would you what would you call it.

Do you call it the transmen.

Yeah. I mean in my mind I think
that's really what it is.

OK, so, so to, to kind
of sum this up, the,

the kind of feeling you had Tylor was.

I'm against these tweets, but
I am for this ban because of

the research I'm reading. Yeah, yeah.
And what were these sources for?

You said it's the Rand, so it's Rand
something report which kind of outlined

the budget. And then, you know,
I just looked up like.

Basic information about, you know,

how long it takes to transition

and what what what hormone therapy
does to to people.

And so I thought men like maybe it would
be better if trans people weren't able

to serve because, I mean, am
I even helped them out?

Because that's going to be really
challenging for them.

But also overall readiness
of the military.

You know, it comes to like
a strong military.

I think it's you know, it doesn't make

the military more strong to ask people to
hide what they are because, you know,

that's an exhausting thing to do.

And it's also sort of goes against what
I consider the greatest values in

the military, the integrity
of the members.

So, you know, I think it
might actually make

the military weaker to ask trans people
to hide who they are and trans people.

I mean, they they aren't monolithic.

You know, some trans people don't
up for any medical intervention

and some due to varying degrees.

I mean, I guess I just always
thought I didn't think that

that trans people didn't. I just kind of
viewed them all as. Wanting to transition
?

Yeah, I just I didn't I guess

I just didn't really know that
there were people in

the trans community that maybe didn't.

Yeah, I mean, transition means different
things to different people.

I think, unfortunately, you know,

issues surrounding trans people are
made out to be political issues.

That's sort of how they're they're
filtered down into what people hear about

trans people. But I don't actually
think it's a political issue.

You know, I was talking about don't ask,
don't tell earlier.

And you were saying, like, the policy
sounds better than it is because like,

yes, in theory, don't ask, don't tell
is like just stay closeted,

but you can be gay. And in theory,

the trans ban like you were expressing
Tyler, is like, well,

it doesn't make sense on paper in this way
. That is presented to me.

And I'm not blaming you for that.

I'm saying, like you, you were reading
this report that presented trans identity

in a pretty monolithic way. Yeah, right.

And I think the trans ban might
have the same effect. Right.

When when legislation or
when policy says, like,

we're banning this group of people

or we're literally silencing these group
of people as don't ask, don't tell did,

you're also leading people to kind of
create biases. Yeah, right. Yeah.

You know, just looking at the
culture in the Marine Corps,

it won't move unless it's sort of like
pushed along by the leadership.

Right. We started this conversation kind
of just talking about the trans ban,

but we've invoked don't ask,
don't tell, don't ask,

don't tell would not have allowed you,
Tyler, to enlist in the Marines.

And as we know, the trans ban would
ban you, Maddie, from joining.

So first, I want to ask Tyler,

where would you be if you are not allowed
to enlist in the Marines?

Oh, that's a good question, because
that is a good question.

I, I could I can tell you I mean, I can
tell you how good it's been for me.

You know, maybe I wouldn't I
wouldn't have free college.

I wouldn't have lived in Hawaii. I
wouldn't have traveled the world.

I wouldn't have some of the
friends that I have.

I wouldn't have the skill sets that I have
of just being able to be resilient.

Yeah, I mean, it would have really harmed,
like, hurt my life for sure.

Yeah, definitely.

Matty, same question to you. Where
would you be without the Marines?

I'd definitely be in a different place.

It's hard to imagine because there
is so formative for me.

And, you know, I can trace so much
back to the Marines. Yeah.

I mean, life would have been much duller,
I think, for sure.

And having the experience of serving the
Marines is unlike anything else.

So it's it's hard to even imagine.

I don't know. I just want to say thanks,

you're the first transgender Marine I've
ever met in my life. Oh, awesome.

Via phone. And it's really
awesome to meet you. And

I don't know, I guess I just
appreciate you explaining.

We'll talking with me in the first place
and then also, like, not, I don't know,

being upset that I had questions
and maybe, you know,

dissenting opinions on on the part of

the policy that obviously isn't
in place in the first place.

And I also wanted to say, like, you're
super brave for serving, especially,

you know, years before I did,

when it was probably a much more hostile
place for anybody in the LGBTQ spectrum.

So I guess that's it. And thanks. Yeah,
thanks.

It's so awesome to meet you
and hear your story.

And thank you so much for coming on here
and and letting me share my story, too.

And, you know, I can't imagine what you
went through coming out while you're

deployed and just kind of have you
have the bravery to do that.

So that's that's where I am right now.

Wow. Thanks. You know.

Yeah, I think it's amazing. And yeah.

Thanks for being open and
discussing this stuff.

I think it's definitely
an open, open story.

You know, we'll see where the story leads.

One thing I like to think about, you know
you know, I transitions myself,

but I may be in the driver's seat.

But I think, you know, everybody
around me is a passenger.

So I think, you know, we're all in this
sort of story together. Yeah.

So I'm hopeful. I think it's exciting and

and it's just great to to get
to talk about this with you.

Yeah. Well, that feels like a wonderful
place to leave this.

Thank you both so much for being on this
call. Thank you. Thank you, Don.

I guess we'll all see each
other on the Internet.

Oh, great. OK, bye, Matty. All right.
