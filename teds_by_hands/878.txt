I have two questions for you.

One: whose shoulders
do you stand on?

And two: what do 
you stand for?

These are two questions that I always 
begin my poetry workshops with students

because at times, poetry can seem 
like this dead art form

for old white men who just 
seem like they were born to be old,

like, you know, Benjamin 
Button or something.

And I ask my students these two questions,
and then I share how I answer them,

which is in these three 
sentences that go:

I am the daughter of 
Black writers,

who are descended 
from Freedom Fighters

who broke their chains 
and changed the world.

They call me.

And these are words I repeat in a mantra 
before every single poetry performance.

In fact, I was doing it in the corner 
over there. I was making faces.

And so I repeat them to myself,
as a way to gather myself,

because I'm not sure if you know,
but public speaking is pretty terrifying.

I know I'm on stage, and I have 
my heels, and I look all glam,

but I'm horrified.

And the way in which I kind 
of strengthen myself,

is by having this mantra.

Most of my life I was particularly
terrified of speaking up,

because I had a speech 
impediment,

which made it difficult to pronounce 
certain letters, sounds,

and I felt like I was fine writing on 
the page, but once I got on stage,

I was worried my words 
might jumble and stumble.

What was the point in trying not to 
mumble these thoughts in my head,

if everything's already 
been said before?

But finally I had a moment of 
realization, where I thought,

if I choose not to 
speak out of fear,

then there's no one that my 
silence is standing for.

And so I came to realize that I 
cannot stand standing to the side,

standing silent.

I must find the strength 
to speak up,

and one of the ways I do that is 
through this mantra where I call back

to what I call 
honorary ancestors.

These are people who might 
not be related to you by blood,

or by birth,

but who are more than worth 
saying their names,

because you stand on their 
shoulders all the same.

And it's only from the height 
of these shoulders

that we might have the sight
to see the mighty power of poetry,

the power of language made 
accessible, expressible.

Poetry is interesting because not 
everyone is going to become

a great poet,

but anyone can be, and 
anyone can enjoy poetry,

and it's this openness,

this accessibility of poetry that 
makes it the language of people.

Poetry has never been 
the language of barriers,

it's always been 
the language of bridges.

And it's this connection-
making that makes poetry,

yes, powerful, but 
also makes it political.

One of the things that 
irritates me to no end,

is when I get that phone call, 
and it's usually from a white man,

and he's like, "Man, Amanda,
we love your poetry,

we'd love to get you to write 
a poem about this subject,

but don't make it political."

Which to me sounds like,

I have to draw a square,
but not make it a rectangle,

or build a car and 
not make it a vehicle,

it doesn't make 
much sense,

because all art 
is political.

The decision to create, the 
artistic choice to have a voice,

the choice to be heard is 
the most political act of all.

And by "political" I mean poetry 
is political in at least three ways:

One: what stories we tell,
when we're telling them,

how we're telling them,
if we're telling them,

why we're telling them,
says so much about

the political 
beliefs we have,


about what types 
of stories matter.

Secondly, who gets to 
have their stories told,

I'm talking, who is legally 
allowed to read,

who has the resources 
to be able to write,

who are we reading 
in our classrooms,

says a lot about the political 
and educational systems,

that all these stories and 
storytellers exist in.

Lastly, poetry is political 
because it's preoccupied

with people.

If you look at history, 
notice that tyrants often go

after the poets and 
the creatives first.

They burn books, they try to get rid 
of poetry and the language arts,

because they're 
terrified of them.

Poets have this phenomenal 
potential to connect the beliefs

of the private individual with the cause 
of change of the public, the population,

the polity, the political movement.

And when you leave here, 


I really want you to try to hear the ways
in which poetry is actually at the center

of our most political questions 
about what it means to be a democracy.

Maybe later you're going 
to be at a protest,

and someone's going to 
have a poster that says,

"They buried us, but they 
didn't know we were seeds."

That's poetry.

You might be in your U.S. History class, 
and your teacher may play a video

of Martin Luther King Jr. saying:


"We will be able to hew out of this 
mountain of despair a stone of hope."

That's poetry.

Or maybe even here, 
in New York City,

you're going to go visit 
the Statue of Liberty

where there's a sonnet 
that declares, as Americans,

"Give us your tired, your poor, your 
huddled masses yearning to be free."

So you see, when someone asks me to 
write a poem that's not political,

what they're really asking me is to not 
ask charged and challenging questions

in my poetic work,
and that does not work,

because poetry is always at the pulse

of the most dangerous and most daring 
questions that a nation or a world might face.

What path do we 
stand on as a people,

and what future as a 
people do we stand for?

And the thing about poetry is that it's 
not really about having the right answers,

it's about asking these right questions,


about what it means to be a writer doing 
right by your words and your actions,

and my reaction is to pay honor 
to those shoulders of people

who used their pens to 
roll over boulders

so I might have a mountain 
of hope on which to stand,

so that I might understand 
the power of telling stories

that matter no matter what.

So that I might realize that 
if I choose, not out of fear,

but out of courage, 
to speak,

then there's something unique 
that my words can become.

And all of a sudden that fear that 
my words might jumble and stumble

go away as I'm humbled 
by the thoughts

of thousands of stories 
a long time coming

that I know are strumming 
inside me as I celebrate

those people in their time who stood up 
so this little Black girl could rhyme

as I celebrate and call their names
all the same,

these people who seem like they 
were just born to be bold:

Maya Angelou, 
Ntozake Shange,

Phillis Wheatley,
Lucille Clifton,

Gwendolyn Brooks,
Joan Wicks,

Audre Lorde,
and so many more.

It might feel like every story
has been told before,

but the truth is, no one's ever told my 
story in the way I would tell it,

as the daughter of black writers, 
who are descended from freedom fighters

who broke their chains 
and changed the world.

They call me.

I call them.

And one day I'll 
write a story right,

by writing it into a tomorrow on this 
Earth more than worth standing for.

Thank you.
